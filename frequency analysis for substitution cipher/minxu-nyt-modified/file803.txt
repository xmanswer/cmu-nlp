The House approved the compromise farm bill on Thursday, and President Bush said he would sign it into law once it cleared the Senate, a step expected next week. The bill, passed by the House on a vote of 280-141, is a reversal of Congress' effort, reflected in legislation adopted six years ago, to wean American farmers off subsidies. Its 10-year cost of $180 billion _ $70 billion more than the cost of continuing current programs _ includes a $40 billion increase in subsidies for large grain and cotton farmers. The election-year bill, which tries to provide money for agriculture in every region of the country, also authorizes a new $1.3 billion dairy program to replace the defunct Northeastern dairy compact and a new $4 billion subsidy for peanuts, a largely Southeastern crop. Included as well are a $6 billion increase in food-stamp and nutrition programs and an 80 percent rise, to a total of $17 billion, for environmental and conservation efforts. Bush, who campaigned two years ago on a ``market-driven approach'' to agriculture, said Thursday that ``while this compromise agreement did not satisfy all of my objectives, I am pleased that this farm bill provides a generous and reliable safety net for our nation's farmers and ranchers.'' The bill is the product of an agreement struck late last week by a Senate-House conference committee. The last debate on it in the House Thursday concerned the fairness of the commodity payments. Under the measure's formula, the larger the farm, the greater the subsidy, meaning multimillion-dollar payments to individual farmers over the life of the legislation. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wisc., tried to prevent passage Thursday, offering a motion to send the bill back to the conference committee to add a strict payment limit of $275,000 a year per farmer. But the motion failed on a vote of 172-251.
