NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Hoochie pants are causing skin problems, career women are doomed to be childless and the most powerful woman in government is quitting her job to be with her family.

(Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) MOVED FOR SUNDAY. BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ Wall Street analysts are supposed to be savvy people who know the industry they cover as well as they know their way home at night. That's why investors pay a lot of money for their advice. Unfortunately, too many of those analysts have behaved as high-paid carnival barkers, trying to lure suckers inside the tent where they would soon be parted with their money. (Jay Bookman is the deputy editorial page editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED WEDNESDAY FOR SUNDAY.
