The year 2001 was as bad as a year can be for Jump, Little Children. In a string of business troubles and personal tragedies, the band was jettisoned from Atlantic Records when the company downsized its list of boutique labels; the group's financial manager drained the bank account and left the country; and drummer Evan Blivins and his brother, accordionist and harmonica player Matt Blivins, lost their father to cancer. ``It got to a point where we had to make a conscious decision to keep going,'' says lead singer and guitarist Jay Clifford. ``Bands usually grow on momentum and die when it's gone, so the hard thing is to stick together and make it work when the odds are against you. Even though we know what we do is what we love. Not a lot of bands do it. I guess we like to fight the good fight.'' Lucky thing, because JLC _ which is based in Charleston, S.C., makes sublime pop music. On ``Vertigo,'' recently released on the band's newly formed independent label, E-Z Chief Records, ornate acoustic landscapes swell with melancholy melodies, dense strings, and twisting chord changes. Clifford's honeyed, soaring voice is, truly, the icing _ thick and sweet, and rich as the ideas that distinguish ``Vertigo'' (which Clifford co-produced with Liz Phair/Smashing Pumpkins producer Brad Wood) from the indie-rock throngs. It makes perfect sense that JLC first convened _ in 1994 _ on the fertile creative grounds of the North Carolina School for the Arts, where Clifford was studying classical guitar. ``It was like `Fame,' '' he says. ``We really were dancing on the tables, and I think it really inspired us to be musically adventurous.'' They took their name from a Sonny Terry/Brownie McGhee lyric _ ``Jump, little children / 'cause Mama and Papa is gone'' _ whose party vibe, Clifford concedes, doesn't exactly fit the serious, literate musings of his band. ``OK, it's an art-school band name. Weird and quirky, and it stuck.'' JLC made the shift from classical studies to Irish music, and moved to Boston in 1993 after hearing that there were more Irish people here than in Ireland. They lasted six months. ``Being Southern boys we weren't used to winter,'' says Clifford. ``We also went broke and got evicted. I remember sitting in Taco Bell on Commonwealth and we just said, `Where can we go to make money playing music?' We'd been in Charleston and knew there was a big busking scene there. The next day we were out on the street making change, and we still live there.'' JLC made the shift to pop music, and has become a busy touring band in recent years; in 1999 the band had an unlikely radio single in ``Cathedrals'' _ a gracious epic ballad that many stations refused to spin at first because the track has no drums. The song struck a chord, however, and the band's been selling out dates in major cities across the country. JLC's remarkably personable live shows have gone a long way toward building a fan base, as well: Clifford and bandmates typically spend a half-hour after every performance talking to audience members. ``When you're an independent band, you have to do a little bit of everything,'' says Clifford. ``Matt runs the Web page and answers e-mails. It makes a difference getting to know people. There's a real connection that happens. We'll be touring until the end of May and then writing during June and July for the next record. And we signed a release form (with Atlantic) two weeks ago that gave us our records back. Happily, in 2002 things have completely changed.''
