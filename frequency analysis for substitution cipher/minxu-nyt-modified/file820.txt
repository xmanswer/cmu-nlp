The change was made Thursday during Apache's annual meeting, where Plank was re-elected as chairman of the board of the company. Plank announced the changes during the annual session. He also announced that he will continue to participate in the management of the company. ``I am going to remain the chairman,'' Plank said. ``Steve and I have been partners for almost the last decade. We have a good working relationship and it is too challenging, too much fun not to be a part of, assuming my mind works and I can put one foot in front of the other.'' Plank founded Apache in December 1954, and Thursday marked the company's 47th annual meeting. He said it seemed to be a good time to announce the changes. ``It's been a great run,'' he said. Plank said he expects the company to do well in some areas in 2002, noting that production is good. A total of seven discoveries have been reported so far this year, with four others in the process, he said. Houston independent oil companies, including Apache, reported a depressed first quarter for 2002. Apache's production actually increased 19 percent during the first quarter, although the company cut back on its drilling program last fall because of high costs. Farris, 54, has been president and COO of Apache since 1994. He joined Apache in June 1988 as vice president of domestic exploration and production and was promoted to senior vice president in 1991. Before joining Apache, Farris was vice president and treasurer of Terra Resources, with responsibilities for acquisitions and divestitures. Previously, he was executive vice president of Robert W. Berry, Inc., an independent exploration and production company. XXX END OF STORY
