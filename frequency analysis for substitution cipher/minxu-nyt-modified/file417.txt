The few Lahontan cutthroat trout being cleaned at Crowley Lake's fish-cleaning station Saturday received scant attention from anglers. But the amount of the trout strain was significant to Department of Fish and Game personnel. Of the roughly 2,050 fish brought back to the Crowley Fish Camp boat docks, only about 15 were cutthroats. That's only 0.7 percent of all the trout examined by the DFG, which checked the haul of 416 boat anglers on the Eastern Sierra's opening day. That number was significant to DFG fisheries biologist Curtis Milliron. ``The cutthroat numbers were encouraging,'' he said. ``It shows how well the cutthroat program has developed. I think you'll see 3- or 4-pounders in the lake soon.'' The DFG has been stocking the strain for several years with minimal results. Four years ago, officials began stocking fingerlings instead. The DFG planted between 15,000 and 30,000 last year. ``It's going to be a nice supplement,'' Milliron said. ``This has been a long time coming.'' +++++ Anglers caught an average of 4.92 fish -- the daily limit is five -- in an average of just more than four hours. Milliron said anglers from boats had far better success rates than shore anglers. But the camp's youth tournament was won by a shore angler. The average fish landed was 14 inches and weighed 1.12 pounds. Of those, 11.3 percent were longer than 15 inches, thanks primarily to a large Eagle Lake strain catch. ``Those were not fish planted last year,'' Milliron said. ``Those were holdovers. I don't think the fish planted last year can get that length. But by August, they should be outstanding, longer than 15 inches.'' The DFG could not determine the amount of trout taken on opening day. Because of early weather reports, a plane to survey the crowd was not delivered and the amount of anglers could not be counted. ``Everybody thought that it would be a crummy day,'' Milliron said. ``It could not have been better, though.'' !dtpost!qqq!dtpost! Two years ago, George Rozuk Sr. and his wife camped out along Hilton Bay with their priest, friends and banners proclaiming they were at Crowley for their son, George Jr., who died in a car accident two weeks before the 2000 opener. The banners had said, ``Crowley-bound in memory of our son.'' Rozuk, who lived in La Verne at the time and now resides in Claremont, again was at Crowley on Saturday. He no longer is married and he was there with just his dog, April. He had attended the opener with George Jr. for 24 years. He still goes but it is definitely different. ``It's a time for me to reflect and remember,'' he said Saturday, a hint of sadness in his smile. ``We had great times here and he was taken away with a full life yet to live.'' Rozuk said he is at peace because, he later learned, the last thing his son did was to check on others in his vehicle, including a baby in a car seat. ``A baby and his legacy lives on because of that,'' Rozuk said. ++++++++ The weather can be fickle in the Sierra, and it was no different on opening weekend. It was shorts and short-sleeve weather at Crowley. Five miles away at Convict Lake, however, the winds were gusting up to 50 mph. At Mammoth Mountain, about 15 miles from Crowley and another 1,500 feet higher in elevation, it snowed Friday through Monday, with the roads snowed over Saturday morning. The snow was steady but not heavy. The road to Lake Mary, normally closed this time of year, remained open. And there were anglers, too, braving snowbanks, snow and cold to fish the lake.
