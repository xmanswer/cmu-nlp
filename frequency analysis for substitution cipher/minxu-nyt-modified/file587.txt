(Cummings, Dayton Daily News)RELIGIONGUSHEE-RELIGION _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This time it is different. The non-Catholic world has a stake in the Catholic Church and its scandals. The current crisis of sexual misconduct by a few priests and the atrocious leadership of some bishops and cardinals will, unlike in the past, force significant change in the church. Non-Catholic influence and secular public opinion will be joined to the anger of committed Catholics to ensure it. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

COMICS-SPIDERMAN _ ATLANTA _ Kevin Fowler, 31, enjoys a guilty pleasure. He spends about $40 a month on funny books, mostly the superhero variety. Guys in tights. Daredevil. Superman. You got a problem with that? ``It's better than cigarettes and drugs and adultery,'' says the father of three. Fowler doesn't hide his habit from his fiancee or his children. It's the rest of society that belittles comics as fodder for kids and geeky collectors. But a tingly feeling is energizing the comics community right now, a ``spider-sense'' that a certain web-slinger can put things right. (Emerson, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) W/PHOTO WITH COMICS-ARTIST _ ATLANTA _ Mark Bagley is an average Cobb County guy who enjoys playing pool, lifting weights and hiking Kennesaw Mountain. He's got your typical middle-aged, middle-class worries _ the mortgage and the economy and his teenage daughter wants to get a piercing, for Pete's sake. What sets him apart from his suburban neighbors is that Bagley draws Ultimate Spider-Man, dollar-wise the number one comic book for Marvel (at least this month), which is the number one comics publisher in the country.

(Erstein, The Palm Beach Post) ENDING-REVIEW _ Fans of Woody Allen have learned in recent years to lower their expectations from this carelessly prolific and intermittently funny writer-director. His latest, ``Hollywood Ending,'' is another dose of Woodman Lite, allegedly a tribute to the blind chaos of filmmaking, but without much insight on the industry or much worth laughing about. (Erstein, The Palm Beach Post) WITH TV-WOODY _ Review of TCM's ``Woody Allen: a Life in Film,'' airing Saturday, as well as an interview with its director, Richard Schickel, who had to re-edit the film after Mia Farrow refused the use of film clips that featured her.
