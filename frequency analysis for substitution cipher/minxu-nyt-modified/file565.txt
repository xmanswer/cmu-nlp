Twin ``Tickle Me Elmos'' were admitted last fall to the New York Doll Hospital, where doctors successfully removed six AA batteries, transplanted two voice boxes and gently washed white ashes from their fuzzy red skin. The Elmos were released into the care of twins who live near the World Trade Center. ``I've never lost a patient,'' said Irving Chais, 76, chief surgeon and third-generation owner of the practice. ``Nobody dies here.'' The hospital has been performing operations ranging from transplants to face-lifts since 1900. Although the hospital's location has changed a few times, Chais sits in the same armless steel chair as his grandfather, Abraham, who opened the business as a beauty salon. After realizing that curling the hair on dolls brought in by his customers' children was more profitable, Abraham founded the hospital. Irving Chais took over the business from his father, Lewis, in 1951, and has since treated thousands of patients, some of them survivors of the Civil War, World War II and the war on terror. ``We got a lot from the World Trade Center,'' said Chais, whose staff, including an assistant surgeon and two nurses, washed the dolls inside and out. ``People brought in dolls and teddy bears covered in white soot.'' In the center of Chais' sunlit workshop on the second story of a Lexington Avenue townhouse, contorted arms and legs protrude from white, brown and black dolls piled knee-deep on the floor. Hundreds of doll heads with parted lips and sleeping eyes line shelves and open drawers along the back wall. Behind the wall is a storage room, where pliers, saws and reaching plastic hands hang from hooks on a pegboard. Porcelain baby torsos are suspended on wires across the tin ceiling, amid boxes marked ``teddy bear eyes,'' ``neck plugs'' and ``doll panties.'' ``One lady said it was like entering another world,'' said Irene Hesse, a doll specialist at FAO Schwarz, who refers customers from all over the country to Chais' hospital. ``People would bring a doll to him in pieces, legs and arms off, and he would put it together.'' Bob Tobasko has been delivering UPS packages to the hospital for 13 years from as far away as Hawaii. ``I've seen dolls chipped and broken, and he'll put a whole new face on it,'' Tobasko said, adding that he once saw Chais sew together a life-size baby elephant. ``He does very good work. He's one of the few.'' In 1950, a woman brought in a fractured doll's head, which she told Chais she had carried with her through three concentration camps. Chais reconstructed the face and body of the German-made doll, which was a gift from the woman's mother in 1925. ``It was a tear-jerker when she picked it up,'' said Chais, whose Army unit helped to liberate Dachau. ``I knew it was all she had left.'' Julia Leonard, 54, has taken her vintage Madame Alexander dolls to Chais to have their joints restrung over the past year. Although other shops in Manhattan repair dolls, Leonard said she chose Chais for the same reason she would choose any doctor: reputation. ``It's experience; it's the touch,'' said Leonard, who has seen Chais stitch the fragile skin on an old mink teddy bear. ``He understands the science behind it.'' Other than pliers and epoxy cement, Chais' most important tools are his hands. Although he often works with razor blades and saws to transplant limbs from one doll to another, his fingers and knuckles bear no scars, only a callus on the tip of his right thumb. ``I don't chop anything off,'' he said while cementing a pointer finger to a doll's hand. ``I make a fine incision.'' Chais has cured the maladies of Chatty Cathys, Mrs. Beasleys and Betsy Wetsys, not to mention Bloomingdale mannequins and Civil War-era voodoo dolls, one of which was decorated with green sequins, multicolored stones and feathers. ``What affected me most is that it was rag,'' said Chais, describing a cloth voodoo doll with parted red lips and painted white teeth. ``It looked like it was screaming, in terrible pain.'' Chais' waiting room -- a line of shopping bags and shoeboxes near the entrance -- has no magazines and is always packed. Some patients are walk-ins, while others stay overnight or for as long as eight months, depending on the level of trauma. Prices start at $25 for minor adjustments like wig fittings or restringing, and Chais does not accept insurance. But doll lovers are willing to pay. One patient, a Humpty Dumpty novelty from 1965, had a ticket listing an $865 fee to custom-design the original fabric pattern and restore the blush on its fading cheeks. ``There is no real price tag,'' Leonard said, ``to bring back the doll of your heart.'' Chais said that more than half the work he does is of sentimental value to his customers. But what he loves are antique dolls, anything before 1925. ``He's an artisan,'' said Marty Haber, owner of A Bear's Place, a nearby toy store that refers customers to Chais. ``There's not too many of those around.'' Although Chais has trained his two adult daughters, Alison and Dana, to carry on the family practice, he has no plans of abandoning his patients anytime soon. ``Once they start talking to me,'' he said, ``I'm out of here.''
