Some wealthy Mexican residents are selling their new vehicles in Texas and then reporting them as stolen to collect insurance money in Mexico, according to the head of Interpol for Mexico. ``It is amazing _ one family can buy seven (Jeep) Cherokees and all of them are stolen within three months,'' said Rodolfo de la Guardia Garcia, director for the international police organization in Mexico. Speaking Tuesday during the final presentation of a two-day border law conference in San Antonio, de la Guardia Garcia appealed to the authorities in California, Texas and other states to help curb the new brand of theft. ``They say it was stolen at the movies or in front of the house,'' de la Guardia Garcia said of the owners of pricey new vehicles he claims are posing as victims. ``The insurance companies are going crazy. In some cases they have hired bounty hunters,'' he said. Vehicles worth as much as $40,000 are quickly sold in the United States for 60 percent or 70 percent of their true value, he said. Some owners sell their vehicles through rogue car dealers or by using fake documents. De la Guardia Garcia said it was all but impossible to tell what happens to cars that are sold in the United States, unless the police north of the border lend a hand. Law-enforcement officers are trying to find a way to tackle the problem, said Gary Stone, assistant commander of the Motor Vehicle Theft division of the Texas Department of Public Safety. One way is to compare stolen vehicle reports filed in Mexico with the list of vehicles registered in Texas, he said. More than 200 vehicles reported stolen in Mexico over the past few years have turned up registered in Texas, Stone said. Of those, 130 have been impounded in police lots for potential return to Mexico.
