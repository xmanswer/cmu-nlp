HBO and NFL Films said Wednesday that they would jointly produce a second ``Hard Knocks'' training camp series, this season with the Dallas Cowboys. As with last season, when the series featured the Baltimore Ravens, some players will be paid to be interviewed as compensation for giving up leisure time, an NFL Films policy for 40 years. Last year, payments ranged from $2,000 to $8,000. After the Ravens' series ended last year, Ross Greenburg, the president of HBO Sports, voiced surprise upon learning that NFL Films had paid the players without telling HBO. At the time, Greenburg said he doubted that the series would return if the policy continued. ``I'm comfortable with it,'' he said Wednesday. ``I can't come up with a journalistic reason not to pay them. The money had no bearing on the final product last year.'' He said he doubted players gave better interviews because they were paid. ``This isn't `Real Sports' or `Costas,''' he added, referring to HBO's journalistic sports programs. ```Hard Knocks' feels like a reality series, not journalism. I don't think the money has any bearing on our access.'' Steve Sabol, the president of NFL Films, a division of the NFL, said: ``If a player spends more time with us, maybe we'll get better stuff and a better film. The money is to grease the wheels. This is the way we make movies.'' The decision to choose the Cowboys was made three weeks ago. ``Jerry Jones opened the door to us and said, `Come in,''' Greenburg said, referring to the team's owner. ``You need a coach and owner willing to let us set up 11 cameras full time for six weeks.'' Sabol added: ``Dallas has always been very accessible to us. We're the ones who coined the phrase `America's Team.'''
