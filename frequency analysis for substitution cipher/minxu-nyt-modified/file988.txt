Even if you aren't a famous Hollywood star with a fabulously decorated mansion, you can still experience what it's like to live like one. And you might just pick up some ideas for your own humble abode. That's the idea behind House Beautiful Celebrity Show House, open to the public until May 29, at 130 N. Bristol Ave. in Brentwood. Proceeds go to the Children's Action Network. ``Historically, show houses have been pretentious and untouchable,'' says House Beautiful editor in chief Marian McEvoy. ``I wanted to do something friendly, attainable and tasteful.'' Not to mention trendy, touchable and high-tech. Walls are covered in soft suede, corduroy and classic British fabrics. And keep an eye out for wall-mounted plasma screens, hidden projection TVs, even an LCD set in the bathroom! McEvoy got some of the hippest young interior designers in the country to work with stars including Jennifer Garner (``Alias'') and her hubby, Scott Foley (``Felicity''); Anjelica Huston (``Prizzi's Honor''); and others to design rooms to reflect the stars' tastes. Courteney Cox Arquette, who plays ``Friends' '' finicky neat freak Monica, inspired her interior decorator and pal Frederick Sutherland to whip up an all-white girls' bedroom with dark wood floors, white shag carpet, glass beads and black-and-white daisies on the walls. Designer Chris Coleman designed a friendly gym/entertainment room inspired by Sly Stallone, with suede and corduroy walls, soft green furniture and turquoise accents, silver exercise equipment, a punching bag (who doesn't need that?), a leather couch and a media wall, complete with minibar/fridge. Yo, even Adrian would appreciate this cozy, calorie-burning room. At Sunday afternoon's gala opening, stars Cox Arquette, Garner, Foley, Tyra Banks and Teri Garr were among the curious folks exploring the two-story house (owned by ``The Rookie'' producer Mark Johnson). ``Omigod,'' said the blue-jeaned Cox Arquette, beaming as she walked into the world's happiest laundry/mud room, designed by Jackie Terrell, with bright orange floors, chartreuse walls, and turquoise and white cupboards. ``This is fantastic!'' When Cox's husband, David Arquette, followed her in, looking very preppy with his crew cut and pale blue cardigan sweater-and-shirt combo, he agreed that this was his kind of washer and dryer room. ``Yeah, like he spends time doing laundry,'' said an onlooker. ``No, I do the laundry all the time,'' Arquette insisted. ``He's the Laundry King,'' Cox concurred, which just goes to show you can never tell who wears the pants in the family. Or who washes them. Tickets for the tour are only available at the door for $25. The show house is open to the public 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Thursday, when it remains open until 8 p.m. For more information, call (888) 255-9069. OZZY AND HARRIED: Teen People celebrated its fifth annual 25 Hottest Stars Under 25 issue Wednesday night at Les Deux Cafe in Hollywood, attracting none other than the most famous young star in town these days, Kelly Osbourne. Ozzy's daughter drove herself (how novel) and her best friend, Mandy Moore, to the shindig, which featured a quick set by Shane West's rock band, Jonny Was. ``They suck,'' spat Osbourne during the band's cover of the Go-Go's hit ``Vacation.'' Moore, being the seasoned celeb that she is, knew exactly what to say in the presence of a reporter: ``No comment.'' Smart move, considering she starred with West in the box-office hit ``A Walk to Remember'' earlier this year. ``Gilmore Girls'' cutie pie Alexis Bledel worked her way to an Osbourne introduction after accepting congrats on her inclusion on the magazine's Top 25 list. Josh Hartnett, Eve, Linkin Park and ``Star Wars'' co-stars Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman also made the coveted list. An MTV special about the issue played continuously on several screens while guests noshed on chicken kabobs and cozied up on huge sofas. Osbourne confirmed that her reality show ``The Osbournes'' will film its second season in London after she showed off her hot pink heels, which matched her famous hair color exactly. ``They're next season's Versace, but I have to give them back,'' she complained. Welcome to the harsh world of celebrity.
