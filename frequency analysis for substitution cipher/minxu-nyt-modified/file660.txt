There should be a secret handshake or some sort of covert signal of recognition when you meet another person who owns a Leatherman tool. It is not that we are smug exactly, but we do have a notable little edge of confidence and capability. It has nothing to do with us, of course, and everything to do with the mega-talents of the multipurpose Leatherman, a virtual toolbox folded into an implement the size of a pocketknife. Measuring about four inches long and weighing five ounces or less, a Leatherman, depending on the model, contains screwdrivers, pliers, a wire cutter, a knife, a saw, scissors, a corkscrew, an awl and just about anything else you might need in the unpredictable flow of a day. How do you leave the house, much less travel, without one? I do not know the answer to that except to speculate that the bereft should just hook up with the equipped. It has occurred to me, though, that owning a Leatherman is a little like owning a pickup truck: suddenly everybody wants to be your friend. Tim Leatherman, an engineer and inventor, introduced the PST Leatherman tool in 1983 and has since released ever sleeker new models, including the latest, the Leatherman Juice, a picnic, office and tool-shop tool. My new CS4 Juice Leatherman, which was chosen from five models, seems custom-made for me. I use the scissors to cut out magazine articles or to remove price tags, the pliers to burglarize my own luggage when I lose the key, and the knife to cut up fruit on the road. You can go to the Web site to chose one custom-tooled for you. Leatherman tools, which are made in Portland, Ore., range at retail from about $29 for the smallest one _ a great graduation gift _ to $80 for the largest.
