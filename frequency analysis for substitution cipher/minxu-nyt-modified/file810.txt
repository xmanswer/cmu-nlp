They'll be in their home whites in front of their new best friends, the suddenly raucous FleetCenter faithful. They'll go in knowing they haven't lost three straight games since late February. What the Celtics may not know, however, is that recent NBA history is squarely on their side in Friday night's Armageddonish Game 5 against the 76ers. Then again, maybe history is what they will need to propel them over the top and allow them to do what they could not do in Philadelphia _ complete the job. However, they'd also make history by losing, which is not the lesson Jim O'Brien &AMP; Co. are going to teach. In 1984, the NBA adopted a 16-team playoff format and all first-round series became best-of-fivers with a 2-2-1 format. There have been a ton of first-round series that have gone the distance, but, for this history lesson, we narrowed it down two ways. 1) We considered series since 1984, which means the Fort Wayne comeback in 1956 is being discarded. That was, after all, the conference finals back then. 2) We considered series that progressed along the same lines that the Boston-Philly series has progressed: One team wins the first two games and the other team wins the next two. We found 18 matches when we put those two criteria into NBA Yahoo/Google. And the Celtics can take some historical comfort knowing that, in 13 of the series, the home team won Game 5. And, in all but one of those 13 series (Phoenix-Lakers 1993), the home team in Game 5 had been the same team that went up, 2-0, as the Celtics did before losing two close games in Philadelphia. (We are not including Thursday night's decisive Game 5 of the Pistons-Raptors series in this study.) In fact, until Dallas rallied from an 0-2 hole last year and upended Utah in Game 5 at the Delta Center, the home team had prevailed five straight times and nine times out of 10. ``We were new to the situation,'' Dallas assistant Donnie Nelson recalled Thursday. ``But the one thing I remember about that series is that we seemed to improve with each game and, as we got better, we got more confidence.'' In some cases, the fifth game has been a blowout, as witnessed by the eventual champion Lakers' 113-86 victory over Sacramento in 2000 or Utah's 102-64 home wipeout of Portland in 1996. In fact, the average victory margin of the 13 times the home team has won Game 5 is 14.8 points. The average victory margin for the five visitors in Game 5 is only 4 points. Three teams that won Game 5s in this scenario advanced to the NBA Finals that same year: Detroit, 1988; Phoenix, 1993, and the 2000 champion Lakers. Two of the 18 Game 5s went into overtime with the home team (Phoenix 1993) and visitor (Seattle 1994) each winning once. One coach, George Karl, has presided over a team that blew a 2-0 lead (Seattle, 1994) and presided over another that came back from an 0-2 deficit (Golden State, 1987). Here are some highlights from the aforementioned 18 series. 1984: In the first year, the defending NBA champion 76ers lost the first two at home to the Nets, prompting New Jersey's Micheal Ray Richardson to utter the memorable line, ``The ship be sinkin'.'' The Sixers won the next two in Jersey, prompting Julius Erving to tell people that you could ``mail in'' the results of Game 5. The Sixers somehow lost, 101-98. 1987: The first comeback from an 0-2 deficit. The Golden State Warriors won the last three, capped by a 118-113 victory in Utah. 1990: The Celtics lost Game 5 at home to the Knicks, 121-114, after leading the series, 2-0. Larry Bird missed a dunk in Game 5. Coach Jimmy Rodgers, the NBA's Coach of the Month in April, was fired shortly thereafter. 1992: The Jazz took a 2-0 lead over the Clippers and then lost Game 3 in LA. Then the Rodney King verdict came down and Game 4 was delayed by three days and moved to Anaheim because of the riots. The Clips won there. Game 5 was the next day, in Utah, and the Jazz prevailed, 98-89. 1993: The Phoenix Suns, with the NBA's best record at 62-20, lost the first two games at home to the No. 8 seed Lakers. Charles Barkley predicted the Suns would win the next three and they did, capped by a 112-104 overtime win in Game 5. 1994: The first time a No. 8 seed beat a No. 1 seed. Denver, down, 0-2, to Seattle, rallied to win the next three, the last two in overtime. The unforgettable picture from Game 5 is Denver's Dikembe Mutombo on the floor, cradling the game ball. Rodney Rogers was also on that Nuggets team. 2000: The Lakers, in their first playoff series under Phil Jackson, went up, 2-0, and then lost the next two games to the Kings. Then they crushed the Kings by 27 in Game 5 at home. The Lakers remain the only No. 1 seed since 1984 to endure a full five-gamer in the first round and win the championship. 2001: Dallas, in the postseason for the first time in a decade, fell behind, 0-2, to Utah, and then won the next three. Calvin Booth hit the big game-winning basket in the Mavericks' 84-83 victory in Game 5.
