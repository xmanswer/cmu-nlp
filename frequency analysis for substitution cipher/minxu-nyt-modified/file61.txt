South Austinites will be green with envy when they hear what Katy Polston and her boyfriend, James Brady Carmichael, wore to their senior prom Saturday night at the Hyatt Regency on Town Lake. The two McCallum High School students were resplendent in their homemade prom clothes made out of duct tape of various colors. Remember that McCallum High is north of the river, not usually considered the vortex of duct tape. Still, for her prom, Katy wore a full-length duct tape gown with accessories made of duct tape as well. ``It was red with white trimming, and I had a purse that was made out of duct tape, and a corsage,'' said Katy, 17, an honor student who is graduating from high school in three years. ``I also made my jewelryand necklace and earrings. I also bought some high heels at Goodwill and covered them with duct tape.'' Meanwhile, James, 18, was the height of fashion in his duct tape tux with tails and duct tape top hat. ``And also his little boutonniere was made out of duct tape as well,'' Katy said. Bubbaland, take note. We're being out South Austined by North Austin here. This all started when a friend of Katy's told her about about a scholarship contest in which students were urged to make their prom clothing out of duct tape. The national 2002 Stuck at Prom Contest, sponsored by Duck brand duct tape, offers a first prize of $2,500 to each member of the winning high school couple. The winners have yet to be announced. Scholarship bucks sounded like a good idea to Katy, who plans to major in mechanical engineering at the University of Texas. So she talked boyfriend James into going for it. The two put together their duct tape outfits at Katy's house in Northwest Hills. Katy says they worked for three or four hours every Thursday, Friday and Saturday for two months. ``They looked hysterically great,'' said Mary Jane Burson-Polston, Katy's mother. ``They worked probably 70 hours on this. I was amazed. My husband and I would have killed each other, and they actually did great.'' The kids went to the store, bought patterns for a tux and a dress, bought cotton material, then covered the material just so with carefully placed strips of duct tape. ``We had to smooth it out so it doesn't get wrinkles,'' Katy said. The project cost about $80 to $90, Katy said. She figures they used 12 or 13 rolls of duct tape to create their ensembles. ``We have a pool table (at home), so we took a big piece of plywood, put it on the pool table and used that,'' Katy said. ``It was good because it was big enough. Our front room was a mess, though.'' The clothing did have one drawback. Duct tape doesn't breathe all that well. ``That has got to be the hottest thing I've ever worn,'' James said. ``There was no ventilation. It was like wearing slickers. I managed with a couple of glasses of water.'' Another problem is if you weren't careful and you put the duct tape on backward, you could end up sticking together on the dance floor. ``But it's waterproof and it's easy to clean,'' Katy pointed out. She says she might even wear the dress again. ``If we get in the finals, we have to send it in,'' she said. ``But if we don't, I might wear it around town a couple of times, or wear it to school.'' The outfits were quite stunning. ``I was chaperoning on Saturday night and they just walked in and everybody went 'Ooooo,''' said Bonnie Baker, secretary for McCallum Principal Shelly Pittman. ``Everybody in the world took pictures.'' ``They couldn't believe it was duct tape,'' Katy said. ``They thought it was going to be kind of gray. We had people who didn't even know us take our picture. It was kind of fun.'' But can she change her own oil? Nope. ``I have to get my dad to show me how to do it,'' Katy said.
