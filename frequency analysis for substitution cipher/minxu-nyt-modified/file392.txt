They are either putting something in the water in the National League or taking something out of the baseballs. Major league home run production is down 19 percent at this stage of the season compared with a corresponding period last season, and the numbers show that National League hitters _ or pitchers _ are the major reason. NL home runs are down 28 percent, while American League hitters have hit 8 percent less. Scoring reflects a similar disparity. In fact, while NL scoring is down, AL scoring is up slightly. Moreover, the National League is averaging nearly two runs less a game (8.61) than it was at this time two years ago (10.57). AL scoring has risen to 10.0 from 9.52. Major league scoring the past two years has dropped from 10.72 runs a game to 9.60 to 9.25. The period in question this season and last covers the first 383 games. Those games were played through April 30 this year and through May 1 last year, research by the Elias Sports Bureau shows. The new, enlarged strike zone _ that is, the umpires' closer adherence to the strike zone as it is defined in the rule book _ was cited last season and has been again this year as one reason for the decrease in home runs and runs. The umpires have been interchangeable the past two seasons, however, working games in both leagues. Thus, their calling more strikes and fewer balls should not affect one league and not the other. Some of the reduction in home run production in the National League is startling. And it is not all the fault of Barry Bonds, who hit 11 home runs in San Francisco's first 25 games last season and eight in its first 26 games this season. The Milwaukee Brewers hit 42 home runs in their first 25 games (through May 1) last season but hit only 19 in their first 26 games (through Tuesday) this season. Jeromy Burnitz hit eight in that period for Milwaukee last season and plays for the Mets this season. Geoff Jenkins hit nine home runs in April last season, only two this season. The Colorado Rockies slugged 41 home runs in 25 games last year and plunged to 21 in 26 games this year. Todd Helton hit half as many home runs, four, as he did last year, eight, while Larry Walker whacked five this year after hitting 11 last season. Todd Walker, Todd Hollandsworth and Jeff Cirillo each hit five for the Rockies last season, but none this season. Walker and Cirillo have a good excuse; Walker plays for Cincinnati now, Cirillo for Seattle. The Pittsburgh Pirates made an early dent in the NL Central race by winning 12 of their first 17 games, but they have dented fewer seats beyond the outfield fences, hitting 12 home runs in 24 games, compared with 26 in 24 games a year ago. Aramis Ramirez hit six a year ago, none this season. Kevin Young hit four last year, two this year. Emil Brown slugged three last year and is not around this season. The Los Angeles Dodgers are another team in the midst of a home run drought. In 26 games last season they hit 34; in 26 this season they hit 18. Gary Sheffield went from seven home runs to Atlanta. Shawn Green hit half as many as the six he had a year ago. Mark Grudzielanek had five home runs in the first seven games last season, but only two in the first 26 this year. And last year the Dodgers had the benefit of a home run by pitcher Darren Dreifort. He is on the disabled list this season. Other NL teams down a significant number of home runs were St. Louis, 39 to 25; Houston, 40 to 28; and Arizona, a league-leading 46 to a league-leading 34. Not one NL team hit more home runs in the first month of this season than it did in the first month of last season. San Diego hit the same number, 20. The Mets were down from 26 homers in 2001 to 23 this year, each in 26 games. The National League total fell from 510 to 368 (2.51 a game to 1.79) with three more games played this season. The American League total slipped to 362 from 392 (2.05 a game from 2.18) in three less games, with the Yankees up one homer from 33 in 2001.
