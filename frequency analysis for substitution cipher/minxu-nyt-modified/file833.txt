The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday through Wednesday with 1,172 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 433 said their current religious preference was Roman Catholic. The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education. Catholics were oversampled and then weighted to their proper proportion of the population. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger. For Catholics it is plus or minus 5 points. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.
