HORROR AND REMEMBRANCE (For use on or after Thursday, May 3, 2002 by New York Times News Service clients)  By VALERIE KUKLENSKI c. 2002 Los Angeles Daily News 	REMEMBRANCE: ABC is the first network to disclose its schedule for Sept. 11, 2002, commemorating the terrorist attacks. 	The news division will churn out a full day of programming from ``Good Morning America'' at 7 a.m. to ``Nightline'' ending at midnight, with only one 90-minute break at 5 p.m. for local news. 	The programming will include memorial events in New York; Washington, D.C.; and Shanksville, Pa., as well as a reconstruction of events leading up to the plane crashes. It's not all about looking back, though. The specials also will examine the changes wrought by and the lessons learned from the terrorist attacks. 	Unlike a year earlier, the network will carry its usual number of commercials on the anniversary date. 	MEANWHILE ...: While a few diehards hold down the fort on Hollywood Boulevard waiting for ``Star Wars -- Episode II: Attack of the Clones,'' this is a good time to look back -- and forth -- to episodes VI and I. 	Tonight, Fox will air Return of the Jedi,'' (considered ``Episode VI'' in the George Lucas series), and ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' runs May 9. 	Both three-hour specials are hosted by our favorite androids, C-3PO and R2-D2, and will feature footage from other ``Star Wars'' films and exclusive clips from ``Attack of the Clones.'' 	The following Thursday, the network's parent studio figures, every good fan will be at a multiplex for the opening night of ``Attack of the Clones.'' 	You're on your own if you want to see just plain old ``Star Wars,'' the 1977 movie that began it all -- even though it is technically ``Episode IV: A New Hope'' in the series. 	RETURN OF THE JEDI, 8 tonight on Fox.
