 Canned tuna comes in all varieties, but some are higher quality than others. Of the three grades available, the two you usually see in stores are ``fancy'' (or ``solid'') grade, which means the fish is in large pieces, and ``chunk,'' which is in smaller bits. Within those grades, there are two types of tuna: albacore (or white) and light. We tasted seven brands of fancy-grade albacore and light tunas, all canned in olive oil with added salt. The brands were packed from Portugal to Santa Cruz. Two brands competed for top place within one vote, while the others fell behind by almost 20 points. The two highest-scoring brands also were the most expensive. First place went to Ortiz (3.95 ounces, $5.95 at Draeger's), which is imported from Spain. All panelists would buy this brand, drawn by its ``well-balanced'' flavor and ``soft, moist'' texture. One panelist also noted that the oil flavor was good. Trailing just one vote behind Ortiz was Dave's (6 ounces, $6.79 at Whole Foods), a Santa Cruz company. Panelists lauded the brand for its ``meaty'' texture and ``clean'' and ``mild'' flavor. A few panelists thought this brand was slightly dry, but all would buy it. Third place, but far behind Dave's, went to A's Do Mar (7 ounces, $4.39 at Andronico's), a Portuguese brand imported from Italy. All panelists might buy this brand. Some liked the flavor, while others found it too mild. Panelists also disagreed about whether this tuna was too dry. Genova (6 ounces, $3.09 at Mollie Stone's) took fourth place, but opinions were mixed. One panelist would buy it, noting it had firm texture and was ``nicely salted,'' two panelists might buy it, and two others would not, citing a ``fishy'' flavor and ``crumbly'' texture. The panel also tasted Flott, Lazio and Trader Joe's, but they ranked too low. Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler, consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Laurent Manrique, executive chef at Campton Place in San Francisco; and Roland Passot, chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur, Menlo Park and Pleasant Hill. A perfect score for any product would be 100. All products are tasted blind.
