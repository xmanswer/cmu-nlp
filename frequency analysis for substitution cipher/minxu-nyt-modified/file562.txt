Weekend Section stories from The New York Times News Service for Friday, May 3 	FEATURES 	NY-IN-PHOTOS (New York) _ Like many natural beauties, New York is effortlessly photogenic. It has fabulous bones and hardly any bad angles. It looks good in anything: rain, sunshine, blizzards. Its personality comes through in flashes: antic, sloppy, noble, rude. Its bad days are more exciting than good days anywhere else. And its good days are the best, period. Since last September, more photographs of the city have probably been circulating than at any time in its history. Countless new pictures, professional and amateur, have been shot; countless old pictures have been hauled out of storage for scrutiny. Three institutions _ the Jewish Museum, the Museum of the City of New York and the Metropolitan Museum of Art _ have big but very different shows of such material this spring. By Holland Cotter.
