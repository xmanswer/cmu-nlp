ATLANTA - Maybe Hootie Johnson just had a senior moment. Johnson, the chairman of Augusta National, ruled last week that past champions older than 65 would not be eligible to participate in the Masters beginning in 2004, and that champions under age 65 needed to play in at least 15 official events to qualify. On Wednesday, Johnson issued an amendment. Johnson lowered the Masters qualification requirement to 10 events co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour, Senior PGA Tour or internationally. ``The fact of the matter is, we were not thorough in our research and we made a mistake,'' Johnson said in a statement. ``Therefore, we are making this change.'' The change most directly affects six-time champion Jack Nicklaus, 62, who likely would have been forced to make the 2003 Masters his last under a 15-event rule. Nicklaus has played in 15 events only once since 1996. But he has played at least 10 events in every year since 1990, except for 1999 when he was recovering from surgery. Johnson spent the past several days fielding telephone calls and reading media accounts highly critical of the 15-event stipulation. Unchanged is the mandatory retirement at age 65, which Masters officials note is consistent with the British Open and more liberal than the U.S. Open's 10-year exemption. Only the PGA Championship exempts champions for life. Former champions Gary Player, 66, and Tommy Aaron, 65, expressed disappointment that their original lifetime qualification was altered. Wednesday's amendment also provides some leniency for younger former Masters champions who might have struggled to meet the minimum tournament requirement. Had the 15-event rule been in effect for 2002, Ben Crenshaw, 50, would not have qualified. He played 11 events in 2001. Glenn Sheeley writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
