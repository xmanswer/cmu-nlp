Ismith Khan, an American writer and teacher whose tales of his native West Indies drew generations of readers, died on April 24 in Brooklyn. He was 77 and lived in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. He suffered a long illness, his family said. Khan's ear for dialect and his ability to render it in print made his novels lasting successes. His debut, the semi-autobiographical ``The Jumbie Bird'' (1961), set in Trinidad and India, was followed by ``The Obeah Man'' (1964). Both novels remain in print. He also wrote ``The Crucifixion'' (1987). A collection of his short stories, ``A Day in the Country,'' first appeared in England in 1990. Ismith Mohamed Khan was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where he attended Queen's College. His forebears were ethnic Pathans driven out of India by the British Raj. He came to the United States to complete his studies and graduated in sociology from what is now the New School University in New York, later adding a master's in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University. Since the mid-1950s he taught at colleges in California as well as at the New School. Most recently he was an adjunct lecturer in English at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. Khan, who was married three times, is survived by his companion, Betty Nicholson; a daughter, Farida Sanders of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Jameen, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Zuleika Naeer of Brooklyn and Rowena Wyatt of Colchester, England; and three grandsons.
