Not that we've ever minded his movies with gravity, from the Bergmanesque drama of ``Interiors'' to the stark morality play of ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' But in recent years Allen's comic aim was shaky _ until now. With ``Hollywood Ending,'' he's made three solid comedies in a row, each a light lark with no hint of morose self-reflection. Well, almost none. The trouble with ``Hollywood Ending'' is, in fact, its ending. After a steady stream of laughs at the expense of Allen's favorite targets _ Los Angeles, the movie business, neurotics such as himself _ the writer, director and star, like his character, starts to stumble. That character is director Val Waxman. A famed auteur whose career has cratered, he gets a last chance to redeem himself by helming a tailor-made New York film for a major studio. The only trouble is, it's run by the man (Treat Williams) who stole his wife (Tea Leoni). ``I'd kill for the job, but the only people I want to kill are the people offering me the job,'' Val laments. Such raging ambivalence freaks out Val, who becomes psychosomatically blind when he needs his vision most. At the urging of his agent, he fakes it, with accomplices guiding him on the set. The results are disastrous, not the inspired chaos suggested by Val's defenders. The only thing percolating is the renewed affection between Val and his ex. Like Val, ``Ending'' loses its way, veering from witty ironies and inspired one-liners to simple slapstick and monotonous blind-man jokes. Allen even relies on lame sitcom-style lies to which everyone is oddly oblivious. It doesn't help that Val, after weeks, never adapts to blindness. When someone in front of him speaks, he turns 90 degrees to address the air. It's supposed to be funny but makes no sense. For some, this also may be true for ``Ending's'' film-crowd in-jokes, with references to ``a 10th of a point after quadruple break-even'' and the line, ``Can a hyphenate marry a below-the-line person?'' Near the end the film also teeters toward irrelevancy, from a banquet attended by Leoni and Williams to a subplot about Val's estranged son. The latter seems tacked on for the therapeutic benefit of Allen, who's had a rift with son Satchel Farrow. Yet in many ways ``Ending'' is classic Allen, from its jaunty vintage music to its lengthy proscenium-style takes of crisp conversation. As an actor, Allen is on the money. His agitated persona is in full flower, bristling with thorns of hypochrondria and instant mood swings. But the real revelation in a strong supporting cast is Leoni. A cross between Diane Keaton and Judy Davis, she's vulnerable yet sophisticated, lovable yet tough, and holds her own in snappy, deftly overlapped dialogue. Unlike he did in last year's ``The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,'' Allen plays close to his age of 66. But _ as always _ he's paired with younger women, the other being Debra Messing as Val's live-in girlfriend, an aspiring actress who's honest about using him. We'll be honest, too. ``Hollywood Ending'' has a terrific first half, and it beats the vulgar misfires of ``Deconstructing Harry'' and the pointless rehash of ``Celebrity.'' But a film named for a satisfying finale should deliver one of its own.  ``Hollywood Ending'' Starring: Woody Allen, Tea Leoni, Debra Messing, Treat Williams Director/screenwriter: Woody Allen Rated PG-13: contains some drug references and sexual material Running time: 112 minutes Grade: B XXX END OF STORY
