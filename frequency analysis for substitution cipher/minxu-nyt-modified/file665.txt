Man, what a bummer. Bobcat Goldthwait turns the big 4-0 this month. We're talking about the same comedian who got arrested for setting fire to Jay Leno's couch, trashed a $10,000 monitor on Arsenio Hall's set, stripped on ``The Dennis Miller Show'' (they had to blot out his privates electronically) and shot a fire extinguisher up Kathie Lee Gifford's skirt, sending her fleeing into the audience. Nobody that nutso ever grows old, yet Goldthwait admits that he's older, wiser and more law-abiding. ``I guess I'm gettin' old,'' he said, ``but if they're coming out to see a freak show, they'll definitely be disappointed. My show is a lot about family and growing up Catholic.'' That was back in Syracuse, N.Y., where Goldthwait admits he was an unruly kid. He grooved on the '70s punk bands and others rebels, such as comedians George Carlin and Andy Kaufman. He popped up on David Letterman's late-night TV show in 1982 and has made a career of ``doing crazy things to get the audience charged up'' ever since. His antics have landed him in a dozen films, including three ``Police Academy'' sequels, the cult classic ``Shakes the Clown'' and the recent Johnny Depp movie ``Blow,'' in which he played a wacked-out chemist with a nose for cocaine. Occasionally, his independence has backfired. He was fired a year ago from ``Hollywood Squares.'' ``I guess I wasn't reading their jokes. I wanted to do some other jokes, but they weren't the kind of jokes they wanted on the show.'' His multi-octave voice has kept him busy on animated shows. He was doing the voice of Floppy the puppet on the WB sitcom ``Unhappily Ever After'' when he fell for co-star Nikki Cox. Now he lives with Cox and his daughter, 15, but he hits the road every weekend doing comedy clubs. He also works as a director and occasional performer on ``The Man Show,'' the bawdy Comedy Central show that goes back into production next week. On a smoke break, Goldthwait was calling from the parking lot of an editing studio in Los Angeles. ``I'm sitting in my old truck, smokin' a cigar,'' he said. ``Now that I'm old, I'm tryin' to act like George Burns as much as possible.''
