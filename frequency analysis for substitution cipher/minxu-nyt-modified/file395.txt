The Cowboys are going Hollywood. They have agreed to provide HBO Sports and NFL Films with limited training-camp access to be featured on ``Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Dallas Cowboys'', a weekly ``reality TV'' show that promises to bare the souls of players, coaches and owner during the Cowboys' first summer in San Antonio. ``Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Dallas Cowboys'' will premier at 10 p.m. July 31 on HBO, it was jointly announced Wednesday inside the Stadium Club at Texas Stadium. ``Jerry Jones and Dave Campo are the producers _ not us,'' Ross Greenburg, president of HBO Sports, said of the Cowboys' owner and coach. ``It's their world. We're just a fly on the wall.'' The Cowboys provide the sequel to the Baltimore Ravens' 2001 training-camp chronicles on HBO, which proved to be one of the cable network's most-watched new shows last summer. The show will focus on three veterans and three rookies during a six-week run (each episode airing four times per week). The players have yet to be selected. Steve Sabol, president of NFL Films, will attend the Cowboys' upcoming minicamps at Valley Ranch to scout out the ``talent,'' saying that he will rely on Campo and media relations director Rich Dalrymple to help him pick out a half-dozen varied and compelling candidates. ``It's ``cinma vrit''. We're beginning with nothing but a white piece of paper,'' Sabol said. ``We have no idea what's going to happen ... that's what is exciting to us as filmmakers.'' Sabol estimates that a crew of 20 will shoot ``maybe 1,000 hours of video'' on the project. Each day the footage will be shipped to NFL Films in Mount Laurel, N.J., where a team of 20 editors will ``try to tame and shape this raw vision into a coherent story.'' Last summer, Ravens running back Jamal Lewis suffered a season-ending knee injury during filming of training camp, while rookies Ortege Jenkins and Kenny Jackson were waived as the series was still being aired. ``This isn't a cheesy, mindless reality series playing on manufactured fears,'' Greenburg said. ``Our players aren't eating worms.'' Jones, who sees his team beginning to turn the corner after back-to-back 5-11 seasons, jumped at the chance for his team to land a six-week, prime-time gig on HBO and produced by the highly respected NFL Films. The Cowboys recently were snubbed on ``Monday Night Football'''s 2002 schedule for the first time since 1990. ``This is going to be a very willing, open access (for NFL Films and HBO),'' said Jones, who is no stranger to putting the business side of his Cowboys on the cutting edge. ``The real winners are going to be our fans.'' This is being perceived as win-win all around. Not even Campo minds the intrusion of television cameras during daily practice, team meetings, team meals and other normally off-limit areas to the media. ``I don't see it as an intrusion in any way at all,'' said Campo, whose wife, Kay, has warned him before about being caught swearing on camera. ``I'll definitely be myself, much to my wife's chagrin ... but that's what reality TV is all about.'' The Cowboys will practice inside and around the Alamodome. Details on a training-camp schedule will come next week, although a team source said Wednesday to expect two-a-day drills to be held ``mostly indoors.'' Jones and Campo share a belief that documenting everything on film will only encourage players and coaches to work their hardest at all times. After all, the camera doesn't lie. nn
