As press secretary to Lyndon Johnson, George Christian was so busy he wasn't home much with his wife and kids. ``Once I had some free time and went out to mow the lawn,'' Christian recalled. ``And some of the neighbors came over to watch me and introduce themselves _ because they'd never seen me before.'' Christian and other Texans who've been top presidential aides accept as truth that Karen Hughes is leaving the White House for Texas to make life better for son Robert and hubby Jerry. ``While I admire President Bush's efforts to make the White House family-friendly, I'm afraid it's a lost cause,'' said Paul Begala, a counselor to President Clinton. ``There is simply no way anyone can be the kind of parent they want to be while being the kind of senior presidential aide they ought to be. It's impossible. ``The hours are killer,'' Begala said. ``I routinely left home at 5:30 a.m. and didn't return till 10:30 at night. ``But worse than the hours is the mental and psychological toll. You never really leave. Your mind's always on the work. We're at war _ or we're being impeached _ or we're trying to pass an economic plan _ or we're preparing for a summit _ or we're trying to restore peace to the Middle East. Or all of these at once.'' Jeff Eller was Clinton's director of media affairs for the first 18 months _ and single at the time. ``It's incredibly difficult to balance what you're doing there with any kind of personal life,'' Eller said. When the exhausted Eller joined Austin's Public Strategies Inc. in September 1994, ``I often was in bed at 8 p.m. _ and happy to be there.'' Matthew Dowd, Bush's polling consultant through the Republican National Committee, and media adviser Mark McKinnon, have kids at home in Austin, and shuttle to Washington a few days every other week. But with e-mail, cell phones, and airplanes, Hughes can keep up _ like she did on the presidential campaign _ but not have so many meetings. Christian cautions that being there is important working for a president. ``I don't know whether it works or not that she's going to continue to be closely involved with him, but not be physically present,'' Christian said. ``That's a real tall order, because your presence is most of the game - to be available at any time.'' But Christian says Hughes' very close relationship with Bush may allow it to succeed. McKinnon thinks it'll work fine. And she will make more as a private consultant than as a government employee. ``I think Karen's going to quickly discover that she'll have the best of both worlds,'' McKinnon said. ``She can still go to Washington or call, and offer her advice and input to the administration and the president. And...come home to Austin where she can get oxygen to her brain. She really won't miss anything. She really can have it all. She'll be inside the loop, but outside the Beltway.''
