I don't know much about birth order. It's an interesting area of study, but I'm just really busy and I have enough trouble remembering the stuff I have to know. What I have managed to glean about birth order has proved to be true the vast majority of the time, however. In sociology or some class, I learned that the oldest child tends to be more conservative and often feels responsible for her younger siblings. In my experience, that means that they're bossy. I'm the oldest child in my family, so I can say that. Younger siblings tend to have freer spirits and they're more flexible. In my experience, that means they blame the older kids for the trouble they get into. ``She pushed me into the table and your favorite lamp fell off and broke, Mama.'' (For the record, Mom and Dad, that is not what happened 15 years ago, but that's OK.) So much for what I've read; here's what I know. It is a miracle that my younger son ever learned to speak. No, he didn't have a problem with his lungs or pharynx or anything like that. It's just that he rarely got a chance to say anything for the first five or six years of his life. From the moment he came home, his older brother, Benny, appointed himself the official spokesperson/press secretary for the two of them. He was a veritable Ari Fleischer or Michael McCurry in superhero sneakers. Before either of the boys was born, I had read everything I could get my hands on about child development. I knew that when a 5-month-old makes those very odd, guttural sounds that he is attempting to communicate. I knew that it's important to talk to the children and read to them often so that they can imitate your speech patterns. So, I'd dutifully and lovingly hold little Bobby in my lap and coo, ``Are you mommy's little angel? Mommy loves you. You're going to study nuclear physics at MIT, yes you are!'' Before little Bobby could utter a complete ``goo-goo,'' his older brother would say, ``He's sleepy. He wants to go to bed and he wants me to have a cookie.'' Well, that was funny until little Bobby turned 3 and I realized that he still could not complete a sentence without his brother interrupting. Bobby would start to say something like, ``Mama, I want ...,'' and his brother would cut him off. ``He wants to hear ``Wee Sing in Sillyville'' again and he wants you to give me a cookie.'' ``Son, let Bobby speak for himself,'' I'd admonish. ``Bobby, do you want a cookie?'' To my dismay, Bobby stuck his finger up his nose and looked at his brother for guidance. I wasn't sure if he was seeking consensus on the cookie issue or if he needed directions on the nasal thing. Even when Bobby did manage to convey his own thoughts, his brother would immediately put his own spin on the statement. ``I want juice,'' Bobby would utter. ``No, he really wants a cookie and juice,'' Benny would inform me. Wouldn't it be great to have someone like that in your own life? Your own personal spinmeister to take your foot out of your mouth when you mess up. I can just hear my spokesperson now, ``No, Moe did not mean that your remarks were stupid. Her words were taken out of context.'' ``Well, that's what she said.'' ``That's what you heard, but in her mind she was thinking that anyone who didn't agree with your profound message is stupid. Her mouth is narcoleptic and sometimes it goes to sleep before she can complete her thoughts.'' Well, flash forward a few years, and now neither of my teens wants to talk to me. Every time I start to say something to them, in unison, they say, ``We know, Mother.'' ``All I said was, `Boys.' You can't read my mind now can you?'' ``You want us to study hard and go to a good college, right?'' ``Yes, but I was also going to say ...'' ``Cookies!'' ``Yes, the cookies are ready.'' Maybe I don't need a spokesperson after all. (Dr. Monica Anderson is a dentist, author of ``Mom, Are We There Yet?,'' and a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
