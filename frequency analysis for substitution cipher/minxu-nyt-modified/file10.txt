Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's hard-driving chief executive who once courted Kansas City's largest employer, stunned the business world late Monday by stepping down from the telecommunications company he founded. Following a year in which WorldCom's stock lost 80 percent of its value, its profits tumbled and its accounting practices were called into question, Ebbers resigned. He said in a prepared statement that he was confident WorldCom would ``continue to lead the industry, setting the standards others will follow.'' But since regulators' 2000 derailment of WorldCom's attempt to buy Overland Park, Kan.-based Sprint Corp. for $129 billion, WorldCom has been far from a leader by many measure. Investors' key measure _ the company's stock price _ has dropped from a high of $64.50 in the summer of 1999 to a low of $2.05 Tuesday. Ebbers' resignation actually boosted his company's two tracking stocks slightly on Tuesday. The company's WorldCom Group stock, WCOM, which tracks the data side of its business, closed at $2.48, up 13 cents, on the third-heaviest one-day volume ever for a U.S. stock. The company's MCI Group stock, MCIT, which tracks the voice business, closed at $3.75, up 31 cents. WorldCom vice chairman John Sidgmore, 51, has moved into Ebbers' top spot. In a conference call Tuesday, Sidgmore vowed to reduce the company's $30.2 billion debt load and said he had no plans to sell WorldCom or seek bankruptcy protection for the Clinton, Miss., company. ``I was not installed in this company to sell it,'' Sidgmore said. ``WorldCom's finances are in better shape than Wall Street thinks.'' But there is little doubt that after 17 years and more than 75 acquisitions, WorldCom is gasping for air in the current economic climate. The company has approximately $1.6 billion in cash and $4.5 billion in debt maturing by 2004. Meanwhile, its revenue and profits are both forecast to drop this year. First-quarter profits fell 66 percent. Last week, after the company slashed 2002 revenue and profit forecasts, eight equity analysts downgraded WorldCom shares. And bond rating agencies Moody's Investors Service, Standard &AMP; Poor's and Fitch all cut their long-term credit ratings on WorldCom's debt. Ebbers personally owes WorldCom $366 million. The company decided to loan Ebbers that money so that he would not have to sell off millions of shares of WorldCom stock to cover margin debts. Sidgmore said Tuesday that Ebbers had agreed to repay the loan over the next five years. Ebbers, a native of Canada who attended Mississippi College in Clinton on a basketball scholarship, built a telecom giant from scores of aggressive acquisitions. Ebbers' acquisitive drive in an increasingly deregulated industry built WorldCom into the country's second-largest long-distance company and a leading Internet provider. His knack for making deals and cutting costs initially showed that long-distance rates could fall while still turning a profit. But all those acquisitions also saddled the company with tremendous debt as price competition became increasingly intense. Whether WorldCom would have been harmed or helped if regulators had allowed it to buy Sprint is a question no one can truly answer. But WorldCom's troubles clearly began when regulators blocked that merger. ``Sprint was (Ebbers') Waterloo,'' said Richard Nespola, chief executive of The Management Network Group, a telecommunications consulting firm based in Overland Park. When the deal was announced in the fall of 1999, Ebbers and Sprint chief executive William T. Esrey said the country's second- and third-largest long-distance companies needed to merge to compete in the changing telecommunications industry. For one thing, they argued, regional phone companies' imminent move into the long-distance business would squeeze profit margins to the point that each company would have a difficult time competing alone. Indeed, the telecommunications industry has been hit hard by fierce price competition in all lines of the business. Both companies have seen their profits fall and, like many other companies in the industry, have laid off thousands of employees. In April, Esrey said he still believed the reasons for the merger were valid, but he acknowledged that a cultural gap between the two companies _ including different accounting philosophies _ might have been underestimated when the merger was moving forward. Sprint is known in the industry for its conservative approach to bookkeeping, and WorldCom is known for pushing the envelope. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating WorldCom's accounting practices and its loans to Ebbers. ``I think that there was strength that WorldCom could have added to Sprint,'' Esrey said in April. ``Sprint could have added to WorldCom.'' But Esrey said the changed telecommunications industry and changes in both companies over the last two years made it impossible to know what really would have happened had the merger been allowed. Tuesday, a Sprint spokesman declined to comment on Ebbers' resignation. While WorldCom's market cap has dropped to a shadow of its 1999 high, Sprint's also has fallen about 70 percent. Reed Hundt, former FCC chairman, called both companies ``wounded animals that would have been allowed to lean against each other for support'' if the merger had gone through. ``I think one thing is clear with each passing day,'' Hundt said. ``And that is there wasn't a good reason for the government to oppose the merger.'' Gatekeepers to future mergers should look at Sprint and WorldCom as a lesson, Hundt said. The companies would be stronger together than alone. ``I think Bernie's story is particularly sad because of the personal story of someone who flew too close to the sun and borrowed too much money,'' Hundt said. ``... But from a business perspective, it's happening to all the companies. They're just the latest one to get prominence.'' On the other hand, some observers said, Sprint should be breathing a sigh of relief that the company is not mixed up in WorldCom's difficulties. Buying Sprint would have only increased WorldCom's debt load, possibly making the situation even worse. ``In the long haul, business is getting beat up whether you're Sprint or WorldCom,'' said Nespola, who formerly worked for both companies. Buying Sprint, many agreed, would not have saved WorldCom from the weight of its current debt. ``WorldCom has obviously been on a horrendous down spiral,'' said Henry Rivera, a telecommunications attorney in Shook Hardy &AMP; Bacon's Washington office and a former FCC commissioner. ``I just don't know whether Sprint would have changed that.'' xxx
