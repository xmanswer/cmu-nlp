A New Jersey man who authorities say deceived retirees into believing he was a wealthy and influential investment expert pleaded guilty on Wednesday to stealing more than $27 million of their money, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said. The man, William J. Zylka, 65, of Mount Vernon, is to be sentenced in July to 6 to 18 years in prison. Authorities said he convinced many of the more than 2,000 investors that he was wealthy and that his friends included William Casey, the former director of central intelligence. The investors, who were from Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Texas, put their money _ their life savings, in some cases _ in offshore investment accounts with the promise of annual returns of 9 to 12 percent. That money, in turn, was invested in Evergreen Security Ltd., an offshore fund. In addition to grand larceny, Zylka admitted that he conspired with James P. Conroy, his neighbor and lawyer, whose case is pending, and Martin W. Boelens Jr., a Florida man who pleaded guilty in January. Zylka used money obtained from fresh schemes to pay off investors from earlier schemes, to pay outstanding debts and to buy luxury items like cars and private plane service.
