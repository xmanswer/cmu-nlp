The final results of the Hewlett-Packard proxy contest, announced Wednesday, confirm that shareholders approved the company's merger with Compaq Computer. Hewlett-Packard said that it planned to complete the deal Friday and begin operating as a combined company on Tuesday. The tally by IVS Associates, the vote inspectors, held no surprises. The company won by about 45 million votes, a margin of less than 3 percent among the more than 1.6 billion share-votes cast on March 19. The final count matched the preliminary results announced two weeks ago. On Tuesday night, after a Delaware judge dismissed his suit to toss out the vote, Walter B. Hewlett, who led the proxy fight against the Compaq merger, said he would not appeal the court ruling. He also said he had decided to stop his review and challenge of the preliminary vote and permit the vote to be certified.
