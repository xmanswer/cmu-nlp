In a crucial early scene of Adrian Lyne's new adultery drama, ``Unfaithful,'' Richard Gere, who plays Edward Sumner, a well-off businessman, husband and father, is being visited at his Manhattan office by his wife, Connie, played by Diane Lane. By most standards, the Sumners have it all: an apparently loving marriage, a beautiful home in the suburbs, a sweet son and a cute dog. Everything, however, is about to come crashing down around them. Connie is being drawn into an affair with a younger man, a romance so intense that she will spin out of control. Nothing has happened between them yet, but she's already feeling pangs of guilt. As the scene unfolds, the room _ they're shooting in an office in Manhattan _ is being pumped full of smoke, a technique that is sometimes used to give a film more depth and warmth, though it's undetectable to the viewer in the finished movie, which opens Friday. Lyne says ``it makes the colors less contrasty, more muted.'' He has used it in every film from ``9{ Weeks'' through his last, ``Lolita.'' The smoke was killing on a set where filming often went on for 18 to 20 hours a day. ``It was brutal,'' Gere said. ``Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was there almost all the time who was shooting people up with antibiotics for bronchial infections. So I said to Adrian, `You've got to cut this down,' and then he said he'd cut it down a little bit but he wouldn't stop it.'' Lane, whose role required huge amounts of physical and emotional energy in passionate sex scenes, said she had even gotten an oxygen bottle for quick fixes of fresh air. Lyne, 61, is at once charming and determined as he runs the cinematic equivalent of a boot camp. ``Adrian's going to do the film the way he wants to,'' Gere said wearily. But despite the conditions, Lane and Gere remain happy with their work and admiring of Lyne. And with good reason _ the film is perhaps Lyne's finest. Lyne certainly has the instincts of a commercial filmmaker. (``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Indecent Proposal'' were big box-office hits.) And his films often cause controversy. (His remake of ``Lolita'' was shown on cable before it appeared in theaters because distributors were scared off by his treatment of Nabokov's pedophilic love story.) And while critics have sometimes dismissed his movies as crass or middle-brow, ``Unfaithful'' is a richly detailed film full of psychological nuances about love, guilt and responsibility. A remake of Claude Chabrol's 1968 film ``La Femme Infidele,'' Lyne's movie, written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr., follows the plot of the original fairly closely. But the films are quite different. Chabrol's moves with clockwork precision and presents its characters with a sense of detached irony. Lyne's unfolds at a leisurely pace and presents its characters sympathetically, delving into their psyches in the context of their habitats. (The film is full of New York locations, from Grand Central Terminal to a SoHo loft.) Both films make no judgments about the wife's infidelity. While that is to be expected in a French film, its moral neutrality is a harder sell in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Gere says that when he first read an early version of the script several years ago, the Sumners had a dysfunctional sexual relationship, which gave the character Connie at least some justification for having an affair. Both Gere and Lyne say that the studio wanted a bad marriage with no sex to elicit greater sympathy for Connie, but both the men opposed that. ``That way there'd be no drama,'' Lyne says, asking, Why would you root for a couple with a bad marriage? ``I wanted two people who were perfectly happy. I loved the idea of the totally arbitrary nature of infidelity.'' Connie and Edward's relationship was rewritten finally as an essentially good marriage. Her having an affair is a result of a chance meeting _ ``because the wind was blowing,'' Gere says. She falls down and badly scrapes her knee on a SoHo sidewalk and, fatefully, meets Paul, a rare-book dealer played by Olivier Martinez. Lyne says that the film has no moral and that he disdains imposing one. But Gere insists that it does have a moral. ``All actions have consequences,'' he says, reflecting his Buddhist world view. ``All thoughts have consequences. Every thought creates a universe. Every action creates a universe.'' Having created the background of a happy marriage, Lyne was careful to cast a sympathetic actress in Connie's role. He says he was ``bewitched'' by Lane in ``A Walk on the Moon,'' in which she played a Jewish housewife who is tempted by an affair with a hippie during the tumultuous summer of 1969. Lyne says she was ``very sympathetic and vulnerable'' in the film. ``You really liked her,'' he continued. ``And given that Connie has a child and she's happily married, she's got an awful lot working against her. So you've got to make pretty damn certain that she's likable.'' As Lane sees it, Connie acts spontaneously: ``She wasn't battered, she wasn't neglected. There's no excuse built into it, like in `Bridges of Madison County' and `Walk on the Moon.' People often have no justification for having an affair. People take risks because it's thrilling to take risks.'' Lane, who has a sort of everywoman quality about her, said that while she was ``partially terrified'' of doing the sex scenes, ``You can't shy away from the vulnerability of nudity. It was appropriate to the story.'' Lyne's repeated takes especially took their toll on Lane, who had to perform at a high emotional pitch and meet the physical demands of sex scenes, which include a tryst in a restaurant bathroom and oral sex in a movie theater. ``Some things we filmed to the point of collapse,'' Lane said. ``He'd just keep the camera rolling until it ran out of film. I got sick. Richard got sick. I herniated my neck in a kissing scene. It's not for the faint of heart to work for Adrian Lyne.'' Still, both Lane and Gere never doubted the director's motives. ``Adrian was infuriating,'' Gere said. ``The smoke, the 20 to 50 takes, the inability or unwillingness to tell you exactly what he wants even at Take 30. At the same time, I never questioned for a moment that every action was based on getting the most out of the situation.'' But after the endless takes comes the task of choosing exactly the right one, and Lyne has a habit of asking lots of people what they think. He starts playing back different takes for a visitor on the set, asking which is best, as if one's opinion is crucial. Lane laughs. ``Oh, he asks everyone what they think,'' she said. ``Then he ignores whatever they say and does whatever he wants.'' Lyne says he solicits opinions because ``the danger of being successful is that it isolates you.'' ``Yes, I ask everybody what they think,'' he continued. ``My agonizing drives everyone crazy. It's a kind of endless self-torture. But in the end it's my decision, of course.'' (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Only weeks before ``Unfaithful'' is to open, Lyne asked Gere and Lane to return to Los Angeles for reshoots. He continued to agonize about the ending. In 1987, Lyne was criticized for changing the ending of his biggest hit, ``Fatal Attraction,'' another adultery drama in which a happily married man (Michael Douglas) has a two-night stand with a book editor (Glenn Close), who turns out be deeply disturbed. In the original ending, Close's character commits suicide off screen; in the released version, she is killed in self-defense. ``How should `Fatal Attraction' end?'' the critic Roger Ebert wrote in The Chicago Sun-Times. ``Thoughtfully, or like a slice-and-dice horror movie? When I saw the film, I felt betrayed and disappointed by that ending _ angry that the film's greatness was thrown away with a cheap, compromised conclusion.'' That annoys Lyne. ``As God is my witness, I did not change the ending'' because of test screenings, he said. ``I've never, never done that. If you court success, you're finished. I simply felt the original ending didn't work _ it felt facile. I'm sure that there's a better ending out there.'' If Lyne hasn't courted success, then it has assuredly courted him. He lives with his wife, Samantha, in the village of Simiane La Rotonde in the south of France, except when working on a film, in which case he stays at their Benedict Canyon home in Los Angeles. But things were not always so cozy. Growing up in London, he says, his family was very poor: ``I remember my father had burns in his jackets from sitting so close to the electric fires. He was a schoolteacher, a Victorian sort of father, very moody.'' Perhaps Lyne got a bit of his drill-sergeant work ethic from his father, who, he remembers, ``left grease marks on my Latin textbook from stabbing it with his fingers.'' Skipping college, Lyne had ``a brief and inglorious period as an accountant,'' he said, ``but I was hopeless in math.'' Then a friend suggested that ``if you don't know what you want to do, go into advertising,'' which he did, starting out in the mailroom of J. Walter Thompson. Eventually he began directing commercials. He was in good company, for the likes of John Schlesinger, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker all made commercials as well. ``There was a rivalry between us,'' Lyne says. ``We were eager to get each others' reels.'' These days he counts his blessings: ``I feel like I'm the luckiest person on earth. But I do this to work with the actors. You have this extraordinary intimacy on the set. The actors become like a wife or husband. ``I remember Tim Robbins telling me at the end of shooting `Jacob's Ladder,' `You've stolen a piece of my soul.' It's like what John Huston said. `Doing a movie is like having a little life: you're born and you die.'''
