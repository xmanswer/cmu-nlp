To write his new memoir, ``The Black Veil,'' Rick Moody had to do a lot of searching _ both metaphysical and actual. His therapist helped him obtain his records from a Queens psychiatric hospital where he spent a month in 1987 after a period of alcoholism and depression. And, although Moody says that revisiting that time was ``incredibly hard,'' the records _ like many of the events described in the book _ did yield some bleak humor. ``When I was being admitted, they asked me to name the president, which is something they always do to see if you're schizophrenic,'' Moody recalls. ``And so I named them all the way back to Harry Truman. So the guy's notes from the admitting thing said, `Possible pathological narcissist.''' Moody laughs, adding, ``Good for you in your elementary school, but don't try it at the psychiatric ward.'' ``The Black Veil'' _ Moody's first nonfiction book _ is not one of the confessional sob stories we've come to associate with the contemporary memoir. It is subtitled ``A Memoir With Digressions,'' but, if its author had wanted to set it further apart from the pack, he might have instead called it ``Autobiographical Cliff's Notes.'' ``The Black Veil'' takes as its jumping-off point Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' which is printed in full at the end of Moody's text. ``It's all commentary on `The Minister's Black Veil,' and yet it's a book by itself,'' Moody says. ``I like that the notes are longer than the story.'' Moody, whose second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' became an acclaimed film and established him at the forefront of his generation of American writers, is sipping tea in a cafe in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where he spends several weeks every winter at the artists' community Yaddo. At 40, he looks like a student himself, retaining a certain gangliness in an enveloping, blue cable-knit sweater that matches his eyes. He explains that his fascination with ``The Minister's Black Veil'' has been long-standing. Hawthorne based the story on an 18th-century Maine clergyman named Joseph ``Handkerchief'' Moody, who earned his nickname by covering his face with a square of cloth for much of his life _ reputedly as a symbol of remorse for accidentally shooting and killing a friend as a child. When Rick Moody and his brother and sister were growing up in Connecticut, their grandfather used to tell them that Handkerchief Moody was one of their ancestors, and during that period in his 20s that led to the hospital in Queens, Moody felt an identification with Hawthorne's tortured minister. Finally, after completing his last novel, ``Purple America'' (whose main character is, somewhat like the Rick Moody revealed in the memoir, a WASP burdened with a debilitating and unspecified guilt), Moody decided to begin ``The Black Veil.'' ``Novels are so depleting that it's incredibly hard to write a novel after you've just finished a novel, because you sort of use everything you've got,'' he says. ``And I had already done the short-story routine once, with `The Ring of Brightest Angels Around Heaven,' so I thought, I gotta have another trick, I need another pitch, you know?'' Moody found that what began as a refresher exercise between novels became his most difficult project to date, taking four and a half years to complete (in the interim he did publish another short-story collection, ``Demonology''). The end result is a virtuosic literary feat _ both deeply sad and darkly funny _ that is not only a bald exploration of the history of Moody's immediate family and of his struggles, but also an account of a genealogical sleuthing expedition, an extended essay on the Gothic, guilt-laden underpinnings of American history, a free-associative commentary on related themes (the significance of Elton John to '70s suburban youth; the death of Joan Vollmer at the hands of her husband, William Burroughs; teen-age mass killers) and, of course, a thoughtful and exhaustive critical study of ``The Minister's Black Veil.'' Summing it up, Moody says, laughing, ``It's a genealogical book in which I figure out that I'm related to a fictional character.'' Moody says he's worked his native vein of gloomy material enough for now. He has just finished the first chapter of a new novel, which, he says, somewhat cryptically, will be about television and dowsing. ``I've billed it as my first truly happy book,'' he says. ``I wanted to work with something that seemed inherently funny to me, and, at least to me, television seems incredibly funny: The more bizarre it gets, the funnier I think it is. I mean, I can't believe s--- like `Temptation Island.' I just honestly can't believe that someone would watch that and conceivably think that that was entertainment.'' And what would he say if Oprah came calling, as she did not long ago for Moody's contemporary Jonathan Franzen, who famously snubbed her? Moody sighs. ``I'll speak for myself,'' he says. ``I would be happy to be on `Oprah.''' The scalding self-assessment quickly follows, however. ``I mean, I would be terrified. Being on TV is really hard. I've been on TV a couple of times,'' he says. ``I would probably do a hideous job. But I would be happy to try.'' (Susan Welsh is a writer for Fairchild Publications.)
