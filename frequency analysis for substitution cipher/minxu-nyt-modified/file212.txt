We know. You're already deep into Rudolfo Anaya's ``Bless Me, Ultima,'' chosen by the City of Austin folks overseeing the ``What If All of Austin Reads the Same Book?'' campaign. Still, you've got the whole summer for that. So you may want to expand your reading list to include Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove'' _ or, if you're a young reader, ``Old Yeller,'' by Fred Gipson _ the first selections for the ``One Book/One Texas'' program officially launched Wednesday. ``Mainly what I did was I saw it on `CBS This Morning,' '' laughs Deborah Hamilton-Lynne, the Texas Writers Month board member who first proffered the idea to link May with a statewide reading campaign. ``I really thought it would be a good idea to select a book written by a Texas writer, because the whole point of Texas Writers Month is to draw attention to Texas' literary efforts and to connect Texas writers with Texas readers.'' The two books were chosen by the writers' month board for their classic story lines and wide availability, Hamilton-Lynne said. A statewide panel will designate the book for 2003. Texas follows in the footsteps of at least 18 states that have tried the program, including Colorado, (Pete Hamill's ``Snow in August''), California (John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath'') and Virginia (William Styron's ``Sophie's Choice''). Those state efforts mirror ones on a citywide basis, like Austin's ``Ultima'' campaign announced last month. Victoria is the only other Texas town with a citywide campaign; residents there are reading Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and Erik Larson's ``Isaac's Storm,'' about the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The reading campaigns have spurred intense participation _ and in some cases, a glut of new sales for the authors. When Chicago picked the classic ``Mockingbird,'' it soared to No. 67 on Amazon.com. Seattle-area book merchants reported selling an additional 10,000 copies of Russell Banks' ``The Sweet Hereafter'' when it was chosen in 1998 as the city's book to read. Information on upcoming discussion groups and other One Book/One Texas activities will be available later in the month at www.texaswritersmonth.info.
