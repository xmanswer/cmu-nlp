BACK IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA Mark Rydell can usually be found directing movies rather than appearing in them. His credits include ``Cinderella Liberty'' (1973), ``The Rose'' (1979) and ``On Golden Pond'' (1981), for which he received an Oscar nomination. But occasionally Rydell returns to his roots as an actor, contributing cameos to films by friends like Robert Altman (``The Long Goodbye,'' 1973) and Sydney Pollack (``Havana,'' 1990). Rydell probably has the meatiest role of his career in Woody Allen's ``Hollywood Ending,'' which opens nationwide Friday. He's Al Hack, the loyal, even saintly agent who watches over Allen's character, a filmmaker with a faltering career. ``Woody has called to ask me to be in some of his other pictures,'' Rydell said in an interview. ``I just haven't been available because I've been making my own. But it was very pleasant to get this call because I always felt I belonged to Woody Allen's family somehow. I grew up in the Bronx, on the Grand Concourse, and lived in Manhattan all of my young life _ appearing on ``As the World Turns'' to pay for my psychoanalysis and all those other things.'' But going from directing to acting is not a vacation, Rydell said: ``The process is a difficult one because you're not used to abandoning your sense of control. And it's absolutely critical, if you act, that you don't use your judgmental faculties. You have to abandon all appraisals of what's right and what's wrong and surrender to the experience. To the extent that you're judging yourself while you're acting, you're not acting.'' Knowing Allen, Rydell also knew where the challenge would lie. ``Woody is very withdrawn and unavailable, generally speaking,'' Rydell said. ``I was faced with a real problem: how was I going to make this relationship appear to be something that's 30 years old and intimate and friendly and open and warm? Because Woody is very reluctant to release those values in his personal life. ``So I decided to force myself on him,'' Rydell recalled. ``When I walked on the set I grabbed him in my arms and hugged him. Over his shoulder, I could see the crew looking shocked at the audacity of all this. I said to him, `You know, Woody, we're the only guys on this set with over a hundred years of psychoanalysis between us.' He laughed and that broke the ice.'' A TWIST OF FATE When the Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi shot ``Baran'' early last year, he believed he was dealing with a relatively obscure subject: the fate of Afghan refugees from the Taliban, seeking safe harbor in Iran. A great deal has happened since then, of course, and ``Baran,'' which opens Friday in New York after a brief Oscar-qualifying run last December, is no longer quite the same film that Majidi made. ``I don't know if Afghanistan is still a subject that interests people,'' Majidi said, speaking through an interpreter from his office in Tehran. ``When Afghanistan wasn't well known, maybe for some people it was very exotic. But now it's not exotic anymore. If the film had come out a bit earlier at the time when everybody was very aware of what was going on in Afghanistan, it probably would have had a different effect. But now, I just don't know.'' ``Baran'' tells the story of a Tehran construction worker, Latif (Hossein Abedini), who finds himself strangely attracted to one of the illegal Afghan refugees employed on the site, a boy named Baran. Latif is relieved to discover that the boy is really a girl (Zahara Bahrami), disguised in men's clothing so that she can work to support her family, but being involved with a foreigner in contemporary Iran is no easier than a same-sex relationship. When Majidi presented his film at the Toronto International Film Festival just a few days before the Sept. 11 attacks, he spoke of it in terms of a political allegory _ the construction site as an image of modern Iran, a society still largely unfinished, and the girl in disguise as an emblem of the invisibility of women within that society. Now, however, metaphors are far from Majidi's mind. Since the bombardment began, he has gone to Afghanistan three times to gather material for a documentary. He made his most recent trip in December, when he visited the refugee camps near the Iranian border. ``During these trips, I was overwhelmed by the situation of the people there,'' Majidi said, ``but I didn't want to make a journalistic film or a tourist film. I've tried to make a film that is very close to the people. The Afghani refugees speak directly to the audience. I wanted to catch the emotions of these people and pass them on. I want people to become aware of the Afghan people and how they lived during the Taliban period and how they are living now. The situation is still not settled.'' ON STAGE AND ON SCREEN Aasif Mandvi can currently be seen on Broadway, where he is the first South Asian actor to take on the role of Ali Hakim, the Persian peddler in ``Oklahoma.'' And as of Friday in Manhattan, he can also be seen on film, playing the title role in Ismail Merchant's adaptation of V.S. Naipaul's novel ``The Mystic Masseur.'' ``I had quite a career for a while playing cabdrivers,'' Mandvi said, ``and I'm quite happy to say I don't have to anymore.'' In ``The Mystic Masseur,'' set among the Indian immigrant community in Trinidad, Mandvi plays a village schoolteacher, Ganesh, who turns a modest talent for writing and an inherited gift for healing massage into a career in colonial politics. ``There are definitely more Asian-American-themed films that I see being made,'' said Mandvi, who has also recently appeared in the independent features ``American Chai'' and ``ABCD.'' ``I guess it makes sense, since India has one of the largest film industries in the world, that the descendants of that here, the second generation, are also finding their way into filmmaking. There are more and more South Asian filmmakers in this country making films with roles for actors like myself.'' Mandvi spent his childhood in Bradford in the north of England and moved with his family to Tampa, Fla., about 20 years ago. ``I started acting when I was very young,'' he said. ``I saw `Bugsy Malone' one Christmas Eve, which was all cast with children, and I thought, `Wow! I want to do that!' So I told my mother I wanted to be an actor, and being the good South Asian mother that she is, she was not discouraging, but at the same time not encouraging. But I did some research and found a children's theater company in Bradford and signed up with them. That's when I wrote my first play as well. It snowballed from there.''
