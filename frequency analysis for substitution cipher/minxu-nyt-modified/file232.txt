ATLANTA - The days of the old-fashioned paper airline ticket are just about over. Delta Air Lines said Wednesday it will issue only electronic tickets on most routes and will charge customers who demand paper tickets an extra $10. Already, more than 75 percent of Delta customers use e-tickets, the airline said. Airlines introduced e-tickets, which work the same way as computerized hotel or rental car reservations, in the late 1990s as a way to trim costs. Customers still get paper confirmation notices _ which since Sept. 11 are required for passengers to get through security checkpoints. Most other big airlines added the $10 paper ticket fee a year ago. Atlanta-based Delta said the fee will be waived for certain customers, such as those who buy high-priced unrestricted tickets, and on some international flights and those operated by partner airlines. E-ticketing has helped speed the growth of online travel booking, which airlines also have encouraged because it cuts processing costs. But some travelers have clung to paper tickets out of habit or fear of a computer glitch, even though airlines say e-tickets are safer than paper tickets because they cannot be lost. ``Usually it's the people who have shied away from Internet booking,'' said Atlanta travel consultant Chris McGinnis. ``They like the assurance of having something documented in their hand.'' Delta said the $10 fee does not apply to paper tickets issued by travel agents. Story Filed By Cox Newspapers
