Several consumer groups filed a petition Thursday asking the Public Utility Commission to investigate NewPower's financial status and, if the company does cease to operate, ensure that its customers can change to providers that offer competitive rates as opposed to POLR. ``If I were a NewPower customer I'd be very concerned and would be seriously considering other providers,'' said Janee Briesemeister, a senior policy analyst with Consumers Union in Austin, one of the organizations that filed the petition. A PUC spokesman said the commission is closely monitoring the company and believes its customers have nothing to fear no matter what happens. NewPower responded to the petition by accusing the consumer groups of misrepresenting its financial and operational status. In Texas, NewPower is the leader among retail providers that have convinced consumers to switch from their incumbent provider. NewPower has more than 70,000 of the 200,000 Texas customers who have switched. Reliant is the incumbent provider in the Houston area. Electricity deregulation in Texas officially kicked off in January. In Texas, if an electricity provider were to go out of business, its former customers would not lose their power. They would automatically be switched to the POLR and pay much higher rates before choosing a more competitive provider. NewPower customers should not be concerned about the company's survival, said company spokeswoman Gael Doar. NewPower has decided not to sign up new customers, Doar said, because it is ``trying to conserve cash'' and ``we're focusing on the customers we have now.'' ``We're in a position where we're looking at all our options,'' one being a sale of a portion of company assets and continuing on a more limited scale in fewer states without the need for additional financing. Doar did not say which states would remain served by NewPower under that plan. NewPower's problems were compounded in late March when the judge overseeing Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy ruled his court would not grant tax immunity to British-based Centrica, which was trying to buy Enron's 44 percent stake in NewPower. Centrica called off the prosed merger, leaving NewPower to search for other ways to raise needed capital. Doar acknowledged that Centrica's decision was a setback. ``But we do think we'll get through this.'' In the petition, the consumer groups ask the PUC to ``investigate whether NewPower has the financial and technical resources'' to serve its Texas customers, and ``take steps to notify NewPower customers of the company's circumstances and ensure that customers can change to other electricity providers without incurring additional fees and charges.'' PUC spokesman Terry Hadley said the commission is ``concerned but confident'' that NewPower customers ``will not suffer any undue harm.'' Responding to the petition, Hadley said the PUC is already watching NewPower closely and ``engaged in an ongoing dialogue.'' The PUC is convinced that NewPower has ``more than enough resources to operate into the third quarter'' and is ``very confident that NewPower is viable,'' he said. XXX END OF STORY
