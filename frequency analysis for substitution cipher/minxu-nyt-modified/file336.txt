The Audit Bureau of Circulations released, then withdrew, its accounting of newspaper circulations on Wednesday. A spokeswoman said that the bureau had discovered that a computer problem had led to the double-counting of the comparative figures for bulk sales for a few newspapers and that the bureau was withdrawing all the figures until it determined the extent of the problem. It is unclear when the corrected figures for the six-month period ended March 31 will be available. The bureau audits paid circulations for newspapers and magazines and is run by a board representing member publications and advertisers. The figures are a bragging point for publications on the rise, and, in the aggregate, an uncomfortable testimonial to the declining appeal of newspapers in the marketplace.
