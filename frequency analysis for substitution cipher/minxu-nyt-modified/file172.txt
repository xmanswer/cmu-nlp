In this quiet suburb southwest of Chicago, an inventor named Ben Skora has transformed an old kit house from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. into what he calls a ``futuristic electronic residence.'' With the flick of a switch, a hidden bar rumbles out from a wall panel. From there, it is just a few steps down to the sunken living room, which is rigged to spin at a gentle speed on a turntable hidden beneath plum-colored carpeting. Skora, 75, was eager to show off the house, which he bought 35 years ago. But some of the building's showier features, which give it the look of a sleek spaceship circa 1975, were in need of repair. The front door, shaped like the iris of a camera lens and designed to retract with a low whir, was bandaged with duct tape. The motorized armchair sat idle, its tiny engine waiting for new batteries. ``It's not really detailed out right now,'' Skora said of his home. ``I'm trying to get it all back on track. And I keep getting new ideas, but at my age it's tough to get started again.'' The Skora house is one of five in the soon-to-be released documentary film ``Home Movie.'' There is not a chic loft or a McMansion among them. All five homes offer an architectural reflection of their unconventional owners, who have a pronounced do-it-yourself streak and have paid little attention to design trends and even less to resale value. Along with Skora, ``Home Movie'' visits a woman in her 70s who has occupied a Hawaiian treehouse for 30 years, a couple who have rebuilt their San Diego property as a playhouse for their 12 cats, a man who spends his days raising alligators and his nights on an air-conditioned Louisiana houseboat, and a husband and wife who live underground at a former nuclear missile site in Kansas. Chris Smith, the director of ``Home Movie,'' is best known for his 1999 documentary ``American Movie,'' which followed an amateur filmmaker in Menomonee Falls, Wis., as he tried to finish a slasher film starring his friends and bankrolled by his uncle. ``American Movie,'' a collaboration with Sarah Price, won the Grand Jury Prize for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival. Both that film and ``Home Movie'' suggest that American culture is more hostile to idiosyncrasy than people tend to admit. Skora is something of a case in point: His second wife, Sharon, moved out of the automated electronic house 10 years ago after 30 years of marriage. ``She couldn't handle'' the endless renovation, he says in ``Home Movie.'' ``Sometimes she'd go to work and she'd come home looking for the kitchen and it's on the other end of the building somewhere, or the bedroom would be changed around.'' For Smith, true eccentrics _ people doggedly chasing a goal the rest of the world finds baffling _ are a vanishing breed. He captures his subjects with a warmhearted attention to detail and a kind of anticipatory nostalgia. ``We live in this country that's founded on individuality and trying new things,'' Smith said by telephone from Milwaukee, where he lives. ``Everyone loves to foster that idea. Somehow it makes us feel good. So it's ironic that the culture as a whole is going so relentlessly the other way, toward uniformity.'' And there is no better example of that, he said, than American residential architecture. ``You have these planned communities all over the place, with houses that are all painted the same color, and you have to choose from just a few floor plans,'' he said. ``It's sad.'' ``Home Movie'' offers a good-natured rebuke to suburban homogeneity. ``I've always been fascinated by the idea of people creating their own universes that are completely separate from the rest of the culture,'' Smith said. ``But I thought it would be one of countless ideas I have that would never be realized.'' He got his chance after the online real estate and home improvement company called Homestore.com decided, independent of Smith, to commission a documentary on unusual houses designed by their owners. An advertising company working with Homestore selected him to direct the film, and Homestore gave him creative control. Homestore recut some of Smith's footage into advertisements, which Smith says have been broadcast in Texas. (The company, which has reported losing about $1.5 billion in 2001 and has said it is shifting its business focus from real estate consumers to professionals, did not return telephone calls seeking comment on its further plans for the film.) In its finished form, ``Home Movie'' clocks in at a little more than an hour, a difficult length to market. It will be paired in theaters with a 16-minute documentary from 1986 by Jeff Krulik and John Heyn called ``Heavy Metal Parking Lot,'' which is about fans at a Judas Priest concert. While Smith was initially inspired by handmade folk-art landmarks, like the late Howard Finster's Paradise Garden in Georgia, ``we didn't want to feature any that had become tourist attractions,'' he said. ``By that point the original dream is sort of lost. It's like, `Let me give you the tour,' and you're the 800th person to get the tour. We were looking for people who are actively involved in the design of their homes on a daily basis.'' For that reason he was instantly attracted to Skora, whom Smith compared to ``a mad scientist in his laboratory.'' ``My neighbors think I'm crazy, of course,'' Skora said. ``The only difference between them and me is that they think so, and I know it.'' The film's other subjects are equally candid about their eccentricities. ``I like being different, and our home certainly represents that,'' said Edward Peden, who lives in a Cold War classic _ a 1960s missile silo near Topeka _ with his wife, Dianna Ricke-Peden. Another couple in the film, Bob Walker and Frances Mooney, have added 140 feet of ``cat path'' near the ceiling of their house. Walker said the renovations began as ``something small we wanted to do for our cats, to quote-unquote elevate their lifestyle.'' Mooney said work on the house accelerated as soon as they stopped worrying about selling it. ``We've put $10,000 into this house _ and probably lowered the value by about $30,000,'' she said. Linda Beech, a former star of a Japanese television series who lives in a lush valley on the island of Hawaii, is shown in the film crossing a rising stream in her SUV to reach her complex of buildings. Its centerpiece is a treehouse, constructed by a pair of boat builders, as large and fully equipped as some Manhattan apartments. Beech is now 77, and has recently disconnected her telephone. Her son Barnaby Beech is naturally concerned that she continues to live by herself in such a remote location. But ``she loves it,'' he said after returning from a recent visit with his mother. ``We couldn't drag her out of there.''
