A Senate panel has cleared the way for Maj. Gen. Daniel James III to become the first African-American director of the Air National Guard, but his long-delayed nomination now faces a new obstacle. Only hours after the Senate Armed Services Committee unanimously approved James, Sen. Mark Dayton, D-Minn., moved to bar the confirmation, saying he wants the Air National Guard keep a promise it made to upgrade F-16s at a base in Duluth, Minn. James, adjutant general of the Texas National Guard, had seen the nomination delayed for months by an Air Force inspector general's probe into alleged misconduct. The inspector general found no wrongdoing. ``I don't even know how to tell you how I feel, because I've seen this process take so long that I'm just a little bit cautious,'' James said Tuesday. President Bush nominated James, 56, to head the Arlington, Va.-based Air National Guard last October, but James has been in limbo pending the investigation. James is the son of the late Daniel ``Chappie'' James, a Tuskegee airman who became the nation 's first black four-star general in 1975. The charges investigated by the inspector general, Lt. Gen. Raymond Huot, were made by old associates who said James had engaged in misconduct since becoming the Texas adjutant general 6 1/2 years ago. Air Force spokeswoman Valerie Burkes said she could not reveal specifics about the allegations. James alleged the claims of impropriety were a way to ``slow roll'' his nomination. He said those making the claims were poor performers or Guard members who had been disciplined.
