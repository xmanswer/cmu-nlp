When Time magazine film critic and Hollywood documentarian Richard Schickel asked Woody Allen to be the subject of his next profile, he got a surprise. The renowned director, who has never been forthcoming about his work, said yes. What followed was an on-camera interview session of more than four hours, during which Allen candidly discussed his movies' themes, analyzing the balance of darkness and light in his work _ and once and for all explaining how ``Stardust Memories'' was misunderstood as an attack on his audience. ``I was astonished when I walked out of that interview,'' Schickel admits by phone. ``I had interviewed him once before for a different show, and he was much more hesitant then.'' After he edited ``Life'' for Turner Classic Movies, interspersing Allen's discussion with scenes from his movies, Schickel got another surprise, this one not so good. Mia Farrow, Allen's former companion and adoptive mother of his now-wife Soon-Yi Previn, refused to let Schickel use any film clips featuring her. Considering that she appeared in 13 Allen films, many of them showcased in Schickel's first cut, it required some trimming and reshuffling. ``She was in some anguish over this,'' Schickel says, ``because she acknowledges that her performances in some of these films are among the best she's ever done. On the other hand, she doesn't want to do anything that seems to celebrate Woody.'' Allen joins Schickel in both praise of Farrow's work and disappointment in her choice. ``I was surprised because, though Mia and I have had personal differences, I've always been a huge fan of hers,'' he says. ``I think she made a mistake in at least not looking at the show first. I always felt she was an underappreciated actress, and that came from having this glitzy Hollywood life, having a movie-actress mother and marrying Frank Sinatra at an early age. People didn't appreciate how good she is.'' And you won't get the chance to do so in the final version of the TCM film. Schickel had to completely remove the Farrow vehicle ``Alice'' from the show, add ``Oedipus Wrecks'' from ``New York Stories,'' and refocus his approach to the clips. ``I'd say there's a net gain with `New York Stories' and no loss with `Hannah and Her Sisters,' '' Schickel says, ``but I think it is less good in the `Purple Rose of Cairo' passage.'' Indeed, the new scenes from ``Rose,'' sans Mia, miss the very heart of the film. Speculating why Allen decided to participate in the profile, Schickel says, ``He's now 66, and despite what he says (in the documentary) about immortality being the artist's Catholicism, I think he's wanting to pin down his film reputation.'' Addictive for any Allen fan, ``A Life in Film'' is a good place for that process to start. Steve Murray writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
