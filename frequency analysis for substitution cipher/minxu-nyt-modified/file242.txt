When the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts opens its ambitious three-and-a-half-month season devoted to six revivals of Stephen Sondheim musicals on Friday with ``Sweeney Todd,'' there will be no escaping its ominous relevance to the state of the world at this particularly scary moment. The story of a revenge-crazed barber in 19th-century London who slits the throats of his clients and, with his mad accomplice, Lovett, bakes them into meat pies, resonates in a climate of suicide bombings, terrorist threats and reignited ancient blood feuds. A cautionary fable about revenge, this 1979 show offers as relentless a Darwinian vision as the theater has produced in the last half century. At this moment in world history, who would deny the kernel of truth in the lines with which Sweeney gleefully justifies his behavior to Lovett: ``The history of the world, my sweet ... is who gets eaten and who gets to eat.'' ``Sweeney Todd'' also embodies, in stark fashion, the ferocious iconoclasm of a composer and lyricist whose musicals have systematically undermined many of the hallowed conventions of his chosen art form. The Sondheim Celebration in Washington, which is the Kennedy Center's most extensive exploration ever of the work of a single artist, coincides with the Broadway revival of the 1987 Sondheim-James Lapine musical ``Into the Woods.'' In a gentler way, that show also offers an unblinking view of a world besieged by catastrophe. Together, the revivals at the Kennedy Center and on Broadway certify what has been apparent to musical theater aficionados for decades: that over the last 30 years, the once humble musical comedy form has been dominated and transformed by Sondheim and his collaborators into something intellectually challenging and morally weighty. ``Sweeney Todd,'' which stars Brian Stokes Mitchell and Christine Baranski, will run through June 30 in repertory at the Kennedy Center, and is the first of the six shows that will play there, with overlapping runs, through Aug. 25. On May 17, the 1970 urban-contemporary musical ``Company'' opens with a cast led by Lynn Redgrave. Two weeks later, the 1984 show ``Sunday in the Park With George'' will begin, starring Melissa Errico and Raul Esparza. After a two-week break, the series resumes on July 12 with the 1981 show ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' starring Esparza and Emily Skinner. Next is the 1994 ``Passion,'' starring Judy Kuhn and Rebecca Luker. The 1973 operetta ``A Little Night Music,'' with Blair Brown, concludes the series. It begins on Aug. 2 and ends on Aug. 25. In addition, Barbara Cook and Mandy Patinkin will perform solo shows of the composer's songs. As much as it celebrates Sondheim's extraordinary achievement, the series can't help but reveal its collateral damage. His high-minded musical-theater puzzles with their soaring semi-classical scores have set such daunting artistic standards for the Broadway musical that what used to suffice on Broadway has come to look shallow and false by comparison. For Sondheim's shows have induced a coterie of fans and critics to bring higher expectations and an analytical sensibility to a form that was once content to be a brash feel-good compendium of catchy tunes and peppy dances attached to love stories with happy endings. Nowadays, even the silliest Broadway trifle is expected to arrive with a concept. Before the age of Sondheim, of course, it wasn't all froth. Certain composers, most notably George Gershwin, with the satires ``Of Thee I Sing'' and ``Let 'Em Eat Cake'' and the opera ``Porgy and Bess,'' pushed the form in more serious and experimental directions. By the time Sondheim came of age, the musical had moved to higher ground, its 1950s paradigm of grace, style and wit, Lerner and Loewe's ``My Fair Lady.'' In those days, the rock 'n' roll revolution, for all the excitement it generated, didn't seem to pose a serious threat to Broadway, which was enjoying what is now remembered as a golden age. As the prodigiously gifted lyricist for ``Gypsy'' and ``West Side Story,'' Sondheim was already the heir apparent to collaborators like Jule Styne, and especially Leonard Bernstein, who shared Sondheim's restless imagination and zest for high-stakes artistic challenges. Sondheim's greatest influence, however, was the team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which ruled the Broadway musical of the 1950s with high-minded shows preaching tolerance, responsibility and the power of positive thinking. To the generation that came of age in the 1940s and 50s, musicals like ``South Pacific'' and ``The King and I'' defined sexual roles, sound mental health, good citizenship and imperialist self-confidence in the victorious afterglow of World War II. Their American and British characters, behaving nobly in far-flung locales, were ambassadors of modern Western enlightenment in a culturally benighted world. The bond between Sondheim and his mentor, Hammerstein, stands as one of the most charged student-teacher relationships of modern popular culture. From Hammerstein, Sondheim inherited a respect for the sort of meticulous lyric craft that has all but vanished from popular songwriting. To Hammerstein's chiseled style he added echoes of the bravura wordplay of W.S. Gilbert and Cole Porter. But beyond craft, what Sondheim took from Hammerstein, who wrote the books and lyrics for ``Show Boat'' and ``Oklahoma!,'' the two shows that are still widely regarded as the cornerstones of the evolved Broadway musical, was the idea that the musical theater should teach values as well as entertain. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Although Sondheim had proven himself as a composer as well as a lyricist in 1962 with the raucous, upbeat ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' it wasn't until ``Company'' in 1970 that the range of his musical talent became apparent. Although updated with Brazilian pop flourishes, the score revealed Sondheim, with his affinity for romantic ballads rooted in opera and operetta, to be a proud descendant of the Rodgers and Hammerstein school. How deep is that affinity? The quintessential Rodgers and Hammerstein ballad ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' (from ``Carousel'') is an inspirational hymn that harks back to Victor Herbert. Nearly 40 years after ``Carousel'' opened on Broadway, Sondheim composed his own less grandiose answer, ``No One Is Alone,'' the song from ``Into the Woods'' that encapsulates its message. But mentor-protege relationships typically cut two ways. Before the pupil can assume the teacher's responsibilities and carry on his work, the son must symbolically kill the father. And in ways large and small, Sondheim has repeatedly sabotaged his mentor by questioning, qualifying and subverting Hammerstein's rose-colored philosophy of faith, hope and moral uplift. In opposition to the world of Rodgers and Hammerstein, which is grounded in platitudinous moral certainties, Sondheim's has reveled in contradiction, paradox and ambivalence. The messages in many of his shows are harsh reality checks of his mentor's pie-in-the-sky optimism. The contradictions built into Sondheim's shows begin with the tension between his sophisticated late-romantic music, which expresses a yearning melancholy, and the modernist skepticism of his theatrical concepts and lyrics that analyze (and sometimes demolish) the very sentiments that wash through the music. Many of Sondheim's greatest songs are dialogues between ways of seeing the world that pit nostalgia against anxiety, rage and cynicism; this ambivalence makes them modern in attitude if not in style. Often, there is an element of sophisticated nose-thumbing. At times, Sondheim seems to behave like a bratty boy genius who refuses to rest until he has rubbed our noses in the awful ugly truth of the human condition. ``Company'' embodies this ambivalence. Bobby, its protagonist, is a 35-year-old bachelor and commitment-phobe, and the lyrics offer a devastating catalog of reasons not to subscribe to the tried and true romantic cliches that the traditional Broadway musical took for granted. ``Company'' also introduces the twin themes that run through almost all of Sondheim's work: the painful search for a genuine human connection and a pervasive (and sometimes oppressive) awareness of death. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Death has always been Sondheim's trump card, and the trickster in him relishes pulling out that card at crucial moments and waving it in our faces. In ``Company,'' it is flashed during the climax of ``The Ladies Who Lunch,'' when a tipsy truth-teller announces to an assembly of party guests, ``Everybody dies.'' The title of Bobby's famous signature song, ``Being Alive,'' forces you to imagine its opposite. ``Company'' provides no happy ending, since the very thing Bobby claims in the song to want so desperately, ``someone to hold you too close,'' is also a source of fear and pain. In ``A Little Night Music,'' the song ``Every Day a Little Death'' observes mortality insidiously creeping through life: ``Every day a little sting/ In the heart and in the head/ Every move and every breath/ And you hardly feel a thing/ Brings a perfect little death.'' At one point in ``Sweeney Todd,'' the demon barber baldly announces, ``We all deserve to die.'' In the lovelorn ballad, ``Not a Day Goes By,'' from ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' the lovelorn narrator contemplates the endless empty ``day after days'' until mortality. In his 1991 boutique musical, ``Assassins'' (in some ways a miniature ``Sweeney Todd''), Sondheim enters the warped imaginations of presidential assassins. After ``Sweeney Todd,'' Sondheim's urge to remind us of death began to soften. At the same time, he turned away from epic musical statements to focus on smaller, more intricate concepts. The sweeping, semi-classical melodies of ``A Little Night Music'' are long gone. ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' with its big hearty show tunes like ``Old Friends,'' was really his last mainstream Broadway score. The turning point came with ``Sunday in the Park With George,'' whose mathematically complex musical structures, like ``Finishing the Hat,'' glossed the minimalist principles of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. The finger-pointing moralist and shockmeister of ``Sweeney Todd'' had softened into the gentler, more avuncular voice searching for answers in songs like ``Children and Art.'' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Although striking melodies are scattered among the composer's later musicals, they tend, like ``Loving You'' (from ``Passion''), to be wistful fragments in a dense conceptual puzzle, rather than fleshed-out, stand-alone anthems. These later musicals follow narrower and stricter self-imposed aesthetic guidelines. The delicate staccato-flavored themes of ``Sunday in the Park With George'' reflect the pointillist paintings of its subject, the French painter Georges Seurat. A guiding musical idea behind the score of ``Into the Woods'' is the lilt of children's ditties like ``The Teddy Bear's Picnic.'' But even these gentler shows express Sondheim's contrarian impulse. As much as it memorializes the artist as hero, ``Sunday in the Park With George'' also portrays him as a self-absorbed handful. In ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' a show business success story told backward, the happy ending is the beginning, when the characters are young, naive and uncorrupted by fame and wealth. The 1976 show ``Pacific Overtures,'' a groundbreaking East-West musical hybrid and a product of the post-Vietnam era, pointedly questions the glib imperialist assumptions of ``The King and I.'' A Japanese production of the show, performed with English supertitles will arrive in New York (at Avery Fisher Hall) in July and subsequently travel to Washington as an ancillary event in early September of the Kennedy Center celebration. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) As you survey the musical-theater world that has grown up around Sondheim, who turned 72 in March, he looms as a rare, exotic flower increasingly taken over by weeds. Over the three decades of his ascendance, the relatively natural acoustic sound of the Broadway musical has been coarsened with shrill amplification to accommodate audiences that have grown up with rock. Why was Broadway so late in catching up with the rest of the pop climate? Languishing in dreams of its 1940s and 1950s heyday, Broadway's parochial culture willfully tuned out the pop revolution for as long as it could. That's why the revolution, when it arrived with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' had to come from abroad. To today's tourist-dominated Broadway audience under 50, the grand old men of popular music aren't Rodgers and Hammerstein but the Beatles and Bob Dylan. The show that is the foundation of the modern musical isn't ``Oklahoma!'' (that's a museum piece) but ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which appeared on Broadway in 1971, after its initial incarnation as a rock concept album. ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' ushered in a loud, splashy, spectacle-heavy international style of pop operetta that engulfed Broadway in the 80's but has since receded, leaving a commercial void. With its aggressive pop acoustics, that invasion paved the way for juke box revues and karaoke fests like ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and ``Mamma Mia!'' that at the moment seem to hold out the brightest commercial hopes for the future of the musical. As it happens, ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' opened just six months after Sondheim's show ``Follies,'' the composer's bitter elegy to Broadway's Ziegfeld era and the dreams it enshrined. More than any of his other shows, ``Follies,'' which was revived last season by the Roundabout Theater Company, could be seen as a slash-and-burn operation that set out to undermine the very conventions it celebrated. For all the nostalgia ``Follies'' lavished on the past, its message was a harsh warning against living on memories and clutching at one's youthful illusions. The musical to end all musicals was literally that, an emphatic goodbye that ensured all subsequent revivals, except perhaps for Sondheim's, would bear a whiff of camp. Swinging his razor high, the demon barber of Broadway leveled the playing field.
