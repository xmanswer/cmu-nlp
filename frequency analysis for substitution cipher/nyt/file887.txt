The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 3: Most of the debris from the World Trade Center has been removed, and discussions about what to build on the site have begun. But a survey of New York City's schoolchildren released this week reminds us that the psychological wounds of this disaster will linger for years. Indeed, the study, sponsored by the Board of Education, shows that thousands of children will need counseling help to free themselves of the dread that has gripped their lives since Sept. 11. The study estimates that about 15 percent of the city's fourth- through 12th-graders have experienced agoraphobia, or fear of public places. About 10 percent of the children surveyed suffered stress disorders, with symptoms that include obsessive thoughts, trouble concentrating, nightmares and sleeping disorders. The affected students were not limited to Lower Manhattan but were found throughout the city; especially troubled were those with relatives or acquaintances who were killed or injured in the terrorist attack. The Board of Education plans another study of pupils in kindergarten through third grade, and is planning to track as many public school students as possible to determine how their anxieties manifest themselves in behavioral or academic problems. The first order of business, however, is to insure that the most troubled children get clinical examinations as well as access to the counseling they need. Psychologists report encountering children who appear fine but are soldiering on under burdens of grief that they need help to manage. School officials say that the cost of dealing with this phenomenon could reach $50 million _ money the federal government should supply. Additional funds are already being spent to train school personnel to recognize and cope with psychological problems. Meanwhile everyone should understand that dealing fully with the Sept. 11 attack means providing therapeutic help for suffering children.
