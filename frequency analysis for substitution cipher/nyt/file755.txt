Random musings in the wake of a meteoric media week in which local teams became national stories: -- Fox's official announcement Thursday that its new No. 1 NFL announcing team will be Joe Buck, Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman should _ finally _ put an end to the rumors about the former Cowboys quarterback making a comeback. ``Boy, I hope so,'' Aikman said. ``I've got a great opportunity to be on Fox's No. 1 team and, no, Steve Spurrier hasn't called me yet.'' -- Before two of the NBA's fastest horses run up and down the court on NBC at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, 20 of the world's fastest thoroughbreds will run for the roses at 5:04 p.m. Preceding Kings-Mavs Game 1 will be NBC's coverage, starting at 4 p.m., of the 128th Kentucky Derby, a race which causes problems for producer David Michaels in that there is no clear favorite. ``We'll handicap the race in our meetings and decide which seven horses to follow with isolation cameras,'' Michaels said. ``If one of our seven win, we figure we've won as well.'' -- A sure sign the chasm between the Cowboys and Mavericks has suddenly narrowed, if not closed: The Cowboys get a major draft spread in ``Sports Illustrated'' and a new show on HBO, but still take a back seat as the Metroplex's most publicized team. The Mavericks trumped them with Dirk Nowitzki on the cover of ``SI'' and Steve Nash in the chair next to David Letterman. -- In case you missed it, Nash wore jeans, blue sneakers, a western shirt straight from the ``Bonanza'' museum and, surprise!, combed hair. The highlight was his assessment of owner Mark Cuban: ``He's certifiably nuts. But we love him.'' -- Switching to radio, KTCK/1310 AM, The Ticket widened its lead in the sports-talk market in winter ratings released by Arbitron. The Ticket's unique, entertaining and wildly successful meshing of sports and schtick finished as the 13th-ranked station of overall listeners with a 2.8 rating, up from 2.5 last fall. Meanwhile, KESN/103.3 FM, ESPN Radio, finished 34th with a 0.6 while KFXR/1190 AM, Fox Radio, failed to crack the area's top 40. KLUV/98.7 FM, new home of the Cowboys next season, finished No. 6 with a 4.1. -- A TV show about the stars and subplots of Dallas? Worked in the '80s for CBS, and HBO is counting on it working in 2002. The ``Hard Knocks'' series will feature one-hour shows each Wednesday night at 10 for six weeks starting July 31. HBO officials estimate that for every minute of film during last year's series about the Ravens that made it on the air, 156 hit the cutting room floor. -- Best line goes to WFAA/Channel 8's Dale Hansen in introducing the Cowboys/HBO marriage. ``HBO now has a third show about the Cowboys,'' he joked. ``They've already got ``Sex and the City'' and ``Oz.'''' -- Look for the legendary Pat Summerall to show up announcing about 11 Cowboys games next season on Fox. Summerall is mulling offers from other networks and even some NFL teams, but appears to be ready to sign a deal that will have him exclusively doing Cowboys games. -- Mavs 1, Cowboys 31, as far as ``SI'' covers. Nowitzki is the first Mav to make it; Emmitt Smith has made seven appearances. -- Fox Sports Net, which will carry live coverage of the Verizon Byron Nelson Classic next Thursday and Friday at 3 p.m., sat down with the legendary golfer in an interview that will air at 10 p.m. Sunday. On his record 11 consecutive tournament wins in 1945, Nelson tells anchor Randy McIlvoy, ``Back then there were 32 tournaments and I played in 30 of them, which is unheard of these days. Now in golf all you need to do to keep your PGA status is play in 15 tournaments. If you play the minimum, you'd have to win 11. I don't think so.'' -- This year's NBC Derby coverage will feature less taped video elements and more of an emphasis on the live scene of Derby Day at Churchill Downs. Said Michaels, ``The Derby on TV is like pictures of the Grand Canyon. It's difficult to translate that kind of atmosphere, but we'll try to bring viewers the real Grand Canyon.'' -- With Collinsworth moving into the booth, Fox's No. 1 NFL pregame studio show will likely feature James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and a revolving fourth chair filled by former/current players and celebrities. ``For the first time in eight years our announcing team will mirror the personality of our studio show,'' Fox sports president Ed Goren said. -- Fox sports chairman David Hill on his new announcing trio: ``Just as John \R Madden\S and Pat \RSummerall\S did, these guys will create their own legend. ... Just give us 20 years.'' nn
