Those convinced that Florida State's 8-4 record in 2001 was the beginning of the program's downward slide should listen to quarterback Chris Rix. ``Rome wasn't built in a day, but it wasn't taken down in a day either,'' said the sophomore. ``This dynasty is not over.'' To that, coach Bobby Bowden adds a cautiously optimistic, ``Amen.'' With 14 consecutive years of 10 or more wins, Florida State entered the 2001 season as the closest thing college football had to the Roman Empire. But youth, injuries and tragedy all combined to give the Seminoles their worst record since 1986. It appeared there were finally cracks in the Seminole's foundation. Yet Bowden says, with a few breaks, FSU could be right back in the national championship hunt. ``Oh yeah, we definitely have a chance,'' said Bowden, looking tan, rested and 20 pounds lighter thanks to a new low-carb diet. ``We had plenty of talent last year, but it was inexperienced. Now it is experienced. And our guys are hungry again. ``If we play our best, I would bet on us every dadgum Saturday.'' There is some basis for optimism. The offensive line will start five seniors, a battle-tested quarterback in Rix, and a healthy receiving corps that may be the best in the country. The defense returns eight starters (seven juniors, one senior) with the best depth FSU has had in years. One of the Seminoles' best recruiting classes ever will arrive this summer. ``But the reason I like this team is that they survived everything that happened to them last year,'' said Bowden. ``Looking back, we all probably did a great job to go 8-4.'' ``Looking back,'' said Rix, ``it was almost like we were doomed from the beginning.'' On Feb. 26, 2001, linebacker Devaughn Darling collapsed and died during offseason conditioning drills. ``Some guys just wanted to leave and go home after that,'' said Rix. ``It took a lot of convincing of some guys that (quitting) was not what Devaughn would have wanted.'' ``I don't know if you ever get over something like that,'' veteran defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews said. ``Nor should you.'' Subconsciously, Bowden said, the coaches backed off and did not work the players as hard in practice. ``In that situation all you think about is you can't lose another one. If you do, then what are you doing in coaching?'' After Darling's death last February, a Florida State team that was already short on experience lost five would-be starters. Receivers Anquan Boldin and Robert Morgan were both lost in August with knee injuries. Guard Otis Duhart also tore up a knee in August. Fullback Randy Golightly tore an Achilles' tendon on Sept. 13. Defensive Eric Powell was shot in the back during a visit to his home in Orlando. ``There was just so much adversity,'' said Rix. ``I'm not sure any team in any sport could have overcome that much and been in the hunt (for the national championship). Having weathered that adversity, Florida State now feels it is ready to reclaim the ACC championship that went to Maryland last season. As always, the non-conference schedule is challenging with Miami (Oct. 12 on the road), Florida and Notre Dame. Bowden is set to celebrate his 50th year in coaching and his first victory this season will be his 324th, passing Bear Bryant for No. 2 on the all-time list (behind Penn State's Joe Paterno). He talks like a man who still has one more good run left in him. ``Sometimes I don't understand why I still want to coach,'' Bowden said. ``I'm 72 and people say I should be out of here. But I'm just excited about this season as any I've ever had in coaching.'' Tony Barnhart writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. E-mail: tbarnhart(at)ajc.com Story Filed By Cox Newspapers
