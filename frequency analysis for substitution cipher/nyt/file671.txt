As the kids do their Music Midtown mating dances in the Sunday twilight, Bonnie Raitt will be up onstage, wailing about the joys of middle-aged sex. ``What I got in mind'll put a grin on your face,'' she'll sing in ``Gnawin' on It,'' a raunchy, bluesy tune that's one of the standout cuts on her new CD, ``Silver Lining.'' ``That song will be the showpiece for any crowd for the rest of my life,'' she says with evident satisfaction. She's on the phone from a recent tour stop in Boston. ``That's my favorite track I've ever cut. I've lived that many, many times,'' she says with a throaty chuckle. Raitt, 52, is old enough to be the mother of the typical Music Midtowner, and ``Gnawin' on It'' could be considered her poke at the youth obsession of the culture in general and the music industry in particular. ``I don't expect the radio or MTV to play me,'' she says. ``I got over that a long time ago. There's a point where the ageism just becomes really apparent.'' Still, ``Silver Lining'' debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard album charts, more than respectable for a niche artist. The album, her 16th after 30 years of recording, has a zesty life force somewhat reminiscent of Raitt's idols, blues giants like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker, both of whom she knew well. ``Now that I'm in my 50s,'' she says, ``at this point of your life, you're not looking over your shoulder wondering what people think about you. There's something very freeing about that. You get friskier.'' The very frisky ``Silver Lining'' (perhaps a reference to the trademark shock of silver hair front and center in her bright auburn mane) comes together better than some of Raitt's other recent albums, in part because she recorded most of it with her regular touring band instead of studio musicians, and in part because of her travels to Africa. ``Help Me Lord'' is like a prayer set to lilting township music (the sound on Paul Simon's ``Graceland'') written by Oliver Mtukudzi, of Zimbabwe, and ``Back Around,'' co-written with Habib Koite, of Mali, provides a more noticeable link than usual between African rhythms and Raitt's Mississippi Delta blues. ``This is such a free period of my life,'' she says. (She was divorced from actor Michael O'Keefe in 1999.) ``I remember being with Muddy and John Lee and that whole generation. They seemed incredibly comfortable with who they were. They just kept getting better with age, and they had achieved a level of, I don't want to say satisfaction, cause you shouldn't be satisfied as a musician. Hey, there's a song: `Can't Be Satisfied.'
