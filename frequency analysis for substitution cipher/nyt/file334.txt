Cardinal Roger Mahony spent the 40th anniversary of his ordination on Wednesday in a hospital room, where he has been recuperating since Sunday from a blood clot in his lung, officials said. ``Cardinal Mahony is feeling 100 percent better every day and is responding very well to treatment,'' said Dr. Lee Parsons, who is treating Mahony at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. Experts have speculated the blood clot developed during Mahony's long flight last week to Rome, where he met with Pope John Paul II and other U.S. cardinals about the sex abuse scandal within the Roman Catholic Church. Mahony previously suffered from blood clots in his lungs after undergoing prostate surgery in 1998. Mahony observed his anniversary by celebrating Mass with Monsignor Kevin Kostelnik, the new pastor of downtown Los Angeles' Our Lady of the Angels cathedral. During the service, the cardinal prayed for victims of sexual abuse by the clergy, said Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for the archdiocese. ``He prayed for all the priests, and all the victims,'' Tamberg said. ``It's still very much on his mind. Tamberg also said Mahony has received hundreds of cards, e-mails and faxes from well-wishers, Tamberg said. ``I am deeply grateful to everyone who has offered best wishes and prayers during this time of illness,'' the cardinal said in a statement. ``When we are ill, or beset by various trials, we are drawn ever more closely to our God, who never abandons us, but makes his presence felt with comfort and hope.'' x x x
