Next the Cannes Film Festival. Now Texas. What gives? Is Woody Allen ditching his Manhattan myopia and reclusive posture to open up to the world? Will he be pitching used cars next? ``I'm having a breakdown, right? No, it's just a coincidence,'' Allen said, settling into a couch at the Four Seasons Hotel Austin during the first day he had ever spent in Texas. He was here to show his new film, ``Hollywood Ending,'' to area college students and filmmakers, then answer their questions. As he's done for other movies in recent years, Allen is visiting four cities for the film, which opens Friday. ``I'd heard good things about Austin,'' said Allen, who was wearing a light blue shirt, loose khaki trousers and his trademark black-framed glasses. ``I heard I'd like the food, that it was a hip town, a college town, a good cultural town. That's why I picked it.'' As soon as he arrived he had a barbecue lunch ``at a rib joint'' (Iron Works); he planned to sample Mexican food for dinner at Manuel's. ``I'll probably wake up in the night short of breath,'' Allen said, ``but I had to see what all the talk was about.'' Along with an entourage of eight, he was joined for the one-night stay by wife Soon-Yi and their two young adopted children, one of whom was born in Texas. This month, they'll all go to France for the festival he's never attended, just as he'd never shown up at the Oscar ceremonies until this year. It's rare for Allen, 66, to leave his beloved New York, where he's shot almost all of his three dozen movies, including ``Hollywood Ending.'' Like his past two pictures, ``Small Time Crooks'' and ``The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,'' it's a straightforward comedy. Allen plays a washed-up director who gets a shot to redeem himself by directing a film for his ex-wife (Tea Leoni) and the studio boss for whom she left him (Treat Williams). The only trouble is, he turns psychosomatically blind from the stress. Concealing this fact, he blindly directs, and the shoot becomes chaos. To hear Allen speak, you'd think he could make his movies blind. Though he writes, directs and stars, he feels his best work is in casting, after which the films almost make themselves. ``People think I do a great job of directing, but I just pick good actors,'' Allen said, noting Leoni's revelatory performance as a smart, sharp fast-talker who just might wish she'd stuck with her ex-husband. ``I cast talented actors and then get out of their way,'' Allen said. ``I don't overdirect them. I let them improvise, ad lib or throw away lines if they hate them. Then they make me look great.'' Leoni has had little chance to shine in films such as ``Jurassic Park III'' and what Allen calls ``one of those big `The Day the Earth Was Eaten' movies'' (``Deep Impact''). But Allen spotted her potential in the little-seen comedy ``Flirting With Disaster.'' ``Some actors can do a brilliant job of acting, but when you give them those little one-liners to toss off the way Carole Lombard, Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn did, they can't,'' Allen said. ``But Tea can.'' Allen also takes little credit for writing. He says he doesn't write great roles for women, but for himself. ``Then I cast Diane Keaton, Judy Davis, Mia Farrow, Dianne Wiest, Goldie Hawn, Helen Hunt, Tea Leoni, and I can't perform on the same level. So when you see the picture, it's the girl's part that comes to life. They're stealing it (the movie) in a way.'' Allen also resists taking credit for his 20 nominations and three Oscar triumphs, for writing ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) and for writing and directing ``Annie Hall,'' which also won the Oscar for best picture of 1977. ``I feel odd about competition for an artistic thing,'' he said. ``To judge this film or that I find foolish. Also, those things are campaigned for. More money is spent in the campaign than I spend to make a picture. ``The film with the biggest studio behind it or most energetic campaigner often wins, as with (producer) Harvey Weinstein. But I didn't think `The English Patient' 'was the best movie (for 1996). I thought `Fargo' was better. ``The awards are just campaigns, favors from friends and opinion, and who's to say this picture is better than that one?'' Costly, ``aggressive'' campaigning wasn't as bad when ``Annie Hall'' won, but even then Allen had to put his foot down. ``I told UA (United Artists) they could campaign for anyone in the movie but me. I didn't want any ads (in trade papers). That's always been my policy.'' The only reason he attended this year's ceremonies was to introduce a movie montage celebrating New York. ``Since Sept. 11, a number of New Yorkers, myself included, have been doing things for the city, trying to rehabilitate it from the trauma,'' Allen said. ``I felt this was for New York City _ it wasn't about getting or giving an award.'' His feelings for New York haven't changed. ``We'll rebuild and move on,'' Allen said. ``To me, the city is exactly the same. It hasn't shaken my confidence. You grieve, get over it and move on. And people digitally removing the World Trade Center from their films is just crazy.'' As for making his first appearance at Cannes, he says the French have been ``supportive of my films for many years and have asked me to come so many times to Cannes,'' where his films have appeared out of competition. ``So I've got to go once,'' Allen said. ``I don't want to seem like an ingrate. And this is the right film to go with. I felt they'd love it at Cannes because it's about filmmaking, and it's got a French reference'' (in the movie's punch line). Thus, his Oscar and Cannes debuts ``just happened to fall this year,'' as did his Texas stop, where he's been ``surprised by the heat. I must say, it's hot.'' Yet another first is Allen's participation in a documentary about his work. ``Woody Allen: A Life in Film,'' produced by critic Richard Schickel, premieres at 7 p.m. Saturday on Turner Classic Movies as part of a monthlong retrospective of Allen's work. In June Allen goes back to work _ in New York, of course. He'll be directing his script for ``Anything Else,'' featuring himself, Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci. ``It's a comedy, but it's not a `funny idea' movie, like the last three,'' he said. ``It's a much more serious comedy.'' Though almost all of his movies are comedies _ he got his start as a stand-up comic and playwright _ Allen often creates dramatic fare such as ``Interiors'' and ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' or comedies of depth such as ``Stardust Memories,'' a much-criticized film that's one of his personal favorites. ``It helps that I'm a low-risk filmmaker,'' he said, noting his smaller budgets (by today's standards) of around $15 million. ``My feeling about the audience is, if they like it, they like it. I'd love them to like it. That makes me much happier. But if they don't, I move on to the next picture.'' He's been able to keeping moving on because ``companies never get rich from me, but they never go bankrupt. Other guys go up and down _ and then out _ but I've been able to diversify and not pander to an audience, and it's worked.'' Through it all, he's paid no attention to the demographic demands facing his character in `Hollywood Ending,`` a man besieged by studio bosses. ``I don't understand that stuff,'' Allen said with a shrug. ``I wouldn't know where to begin. I can't tell you who my audience is, and I haven't had to. ``I have never had to sit in a hotel room with studio heads and pitch ideas. They don't get to read the script, approve the casting or have final cut. I do. That is what I call a charmed life.'' XXX END OF STORY
