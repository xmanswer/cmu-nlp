Half the senior class of Bertie High School in Windsor, N.C., dragged themselves out of bed at 5 a.m. on the second day of their trip to New York City. Two hours later, all signs of grogginess were gone. The six teen-age girls and their two advisers screamed and waved madly at the cameras outside NBC's ``Today'' show. Brandishing a 6-foot-long, pale blue banner covered in butterflies and confetti that said ``Bertie High School, Class of 2002,'' they maneuvered to the front of the crowd. ``I wanted to be on TV,'' said Aubrey Griffin, 18, barely containing her excitement. ``I got to speak on TV. I talked to Al.'' ``Al'' is Al Roker, ``Today's'' jolly weatherman. When he steps outside, the hundreds of people who jam the plaza outside the NBC studio in Rockefeller Center go nuts. They jump, hoot and wave signs like a convention crowd. The homemade placards announce birthdays and engagements, pinpoint home towns and proclaim their love. ``We made grandma get up at 3:00 a.m. to come see Al, Matt, Katie and Anne,'' says one sign, referring to the reigning superstars of morning television. Matt Lauer, Katie Couric and Anne Curry work inside the studio, chatting up celebrities and dispensing news. Outside, Roker is king. But he admits he's not the main attraction. ``I'm a realist,'' he said backstage after a recent show, ``friends say to me, 'oh, they really love you,' but the fact of the matter is people want to get on TV.'' It's true. ``Television has become accepted as a vehicle to celebrity and validation,'' says Dr. James Hogge, a psychology professor at Vanderbilt University. ``If one is able to appear on TV, especially in the presence of a highly-regarded celebrity, one's own status and self-esteem are increased.'' That kind of thinking turned ``Today'' into one of New York's top tourist destinations. ``There are people out there who want their 15 minutes of fame,'' says Liz Smith, director of marketing for Big Apple Greeter, a tourism company in the city. ``That's why they love going to the 'Today' show.'' In 1996, NBC moved its No. 1-rated morning show to a first floor studio in midtown Manhattan. It added a huge corner window and invited fans to see the show live. Soon after, the live audience became part of the show. Now hundreds of people from all over America and foreign countries come to New York, rise at ungodly hours, brave inclement weather and test the bounds of sanity to mug for the cameras on national television. ``My heart was pounding so hard when the cameras did the first pan,'' said Melissa Robertson, 43, from Detroit. ``I was standing next to a little boy and we were both like, 'Did we get on TV?''' Robertson called her mother in Nebraska a few minutes later to make sure she was ``tuned in.'' For her, ``Today'' was ``top 5'' on her list of things to do in New York. For Susan Peal, 35, it was No. 1. The Indianapolis resident was in New York four years ago. ``I got interviewed by Al, Matt and Katie,'' she said. ``I wanted to do it again.'' This time, Peal brought her mom, Juanita Stuckey, 60, of Martins Ferry, Ohio. Arriving at 4:30 a.m., they were the first ones there. ``We saw Matt get out of his car,'' Stuckey gushed. To get noticed, Peal and Stuckey wore red, white and blue headbands with a protruding NBC logo made out of carton paper. An outrageous hat, says Roker, is a good way to get his attention. He clearly recalls two women who wore lobster hats recently. But the sure way to catch his eye: ``Bring a baby, bring food, don't bring baby food,'' he said. Roker and the gang refer to the outside audience as the fifth cast member. ``There's a certain unpredictability that they bring to the show,'' he said. ``You never know who's going to be out there or what they're going to do.'' What is predictable, however, is the audience itself. There are always at least a hundred people outside, even in the coldest winter day. ``It doesn't matter what the weather's like,'' Roker said, ``People will be out there.'' He remembers a particularly severe lightning storm when he had to say, ``Listen, I don't want to be here. Go home!'' The size of the audience varies throughout the year, says Allison Gollust, a spokeswoman for NBC. The busiest times are holidays, spring break and the summer months. Fridays in the summer are the most crowded due to the show's concert series, which attracts upwards of 3,000 people. Gollust said the largest audience exceeded 7,000 people for a Ricky Martin concert last May. But even without the ``Vida Loca'' star, people show up in hordes to vie for the cameras. Rhonda Washington, 31, and Shannan Stephens, 29, had an added reason -- to show appreciation to their boss in Indiana who ``footed the bill'' for their trip to New York. They got to the studio at 6 a.m. with a pink sign that said ``Thanks Fred.'' (EDITORS: There is no charge for use of this story, but please send a tearsheet to Professor Stephen D.
