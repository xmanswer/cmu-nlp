The Mavericks have an NBA-record five international players on their roster: Germany's Dirk Nowitzki, Canada's Steve Nash, Mexico's Eduardo Najera, China's Wang Zhizhi and France's Tariq Abdul-Wahad (on the inactive list). Peja Stojakovic and Vlade Divac (both Yugoslavia) and Hedo Turkoglu (Turkey) are the Kings' representatives from Europe. Thus, when the Mavericks face the Kings at 5:30 p.m. Saturday at Arco Arena in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinals, much will be made about the diversity of this group of NBA millionaires. ``It's going to be a very diverse series,'' said Nash, fresh off Wednesday's appearance on ``The Late Show With David Letterman.'' ``There's a lot of guys coming from lots of different countries and backgrounds. ``It's going to be a really exciting series with a lot of color, and really fun.'' NBA commissioner David Stern recently talked about making his league a global league. This season's new rules changes _ with more emphasis on jump-shooting and less on dribbling and backing foes into the low post _ are geared toward international players whose staple is the jump shot. Some coaches even believe the new zone-defense rules are tailor-made for the foreign players, who grew up playing against zones on a day-to-day basis. ``There are a lot of players over in Europe that are used to playing against a zone, and know what to do when they don't have the ball,'' Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``All those guys from Europe can shoot, all those guys can pass. ``So, for a short time you'll see the overseas emphasis shift. Eight years ago it was de-emphasized to bring in a guy from Europe, now it'll be overemphasized.'' While Nelson said he believes the best basketball players are still American-born, he said the trend toward signing foreign players will be a bonus for the NBA. ``What it's going to do for basketball at the grassroots level is our kids are going to be forced to learn how to do those things, which will be healthy for our game,'' he said. ``More and more kids on playgrounds, instead of going one-on-one and isolating and making 10 dribbles while you're backing your guy down in the post _ those things that were destroying our game from an aesthetic point of view _ they're going to readjust their games. ``Now they're seeing a different brand of basketball, an exciting brand of basketball, and the brand of basketball that James Naismith had in mind when he created the game of basketball.'' Nelson has probably scouted more foreign players than anyone in the NBA, and he is the main reason the Mavericks acquired Nowitzki, Nash and Wang. Nelson also was an assistant coach with the Lithuanian national team that nearly defeated the USA Dream Team in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and he has seen an NBA trend toward acquiring foreign players. While the language barrier is something most foreign players have to overcome _ Wang still struggles with that aspect of the game _ they all agreed that basketball is a universal language. ``It's fun to watch all the European players that come over and have a big impact,'' Nowitzki said. ``All of the European players are getting better every year, and European players in general is taking a little step. ``I'm good friends with Peja and Hedo _ I don't know Vlade that well _ but it's going to be fun to play against them.'' Earlier this year, the European media voted Stojakovic as the best international player in the NBA. Nowitzki, who was selected second-team All-NBA on Wednesday, didn't bat an eye while agreeing that Stojakovic is Europe's best player. ``His range is pretty much unlimited,'' Nowitzki said. ``He gets his shot off so quick that if you're not there for a second, it's gone. ``He's a tough player to stop, and he's definitely one of our priorities. You try to deny his catches, push him out farther and make him put it on the court.'' Still, Nowitzki is the player many are comparing to Larry Bird. Nelson expects many more internationals to use Nowitzki's success as a gauge and wind up in the NBA. ``Eventually, a lot of international players are going to be playing in the playoffs and starting,'' Najera said. ``We've got Dirk being our horse right now, so he's going to be a great matchup for us.'' And a great matchup for the world to see. nn
