Over the years, NBC drama series have gone from the tales of the Old West to the social and political issues of the day. -``Bonanza'' (1959-73) featured frequent dustups between brothers Hoss (Dan Blocker) and Little Joe (Michael Landon) that often finished with Landon's high-pitched, infectious laughter. -``I Spy'' (1965-68) cast stand-up comic Bill Cosby and made use of his witty delivery. -``McMillan and Wife'' (1971-77) starred Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James as a crime-fighting couple inspired by Nick and Nora Charles. -``The Rockford Files'' (1974-80) featured James Garner as a private eye who often glared at his ex-con pal Angel when he botched an investigation. -``Hill Street Blues'' (1981-87) balanced the perils of big-city crime fighting with precinct politics and colorful characters, such as barking, growling undercover detective Belker, played by Bruce Weitz. The ensemble cast had a big impact on redefining the drama. -``St. Elsewhere'' (1982-88), also with an ensemble cast, terminated one excessively annoying patient by having her suffocate in an accidentally sandwiched bed. -``Miami Vice'' (1984-89) didn't exactly provoke laughs, but it probably had the greatest impact on the American male wardrobe since Fess Parker's ``Davy Crockett'' coonskin cap. The Don Johnson look included a bright T-shirt, a sport coat with sleeves pushed up, no socks and a three-day stubble. -``L.A. Law'' (1986-94) dispatched an unsavory attorney (Diana Muldaur's Rosalind Shays) down an elevator shaft when the car failed to arrive but the doors opened anyway. -``Law &AMP; Order'' (1990-present) -- and its unprecedented two spin-offs simultaneously on the air -- spur discussions about the criminal justice system. -``The West Wing'' (1999-present) has raised interest in the inner workings of the White House. -``ER'' (1996-present) has cast a light on the strengths and shortcomings of American health care.
