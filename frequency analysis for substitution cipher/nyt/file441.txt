Octavio Dotel probably thought he was making a pretty good pitch. Facing Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero, the Astros reliever fell behind after throwing two pitches outside the strike zone, but Dotel wasn't about to give up. Not while trying to protect a two-run lead in the seventh inning. So Dotel's third pitch was also outside the strike zone. Unfortunately for Dotel _ and the Astros _ that fastball was still inside Guerrero's strike zone. The Montreal slugger sent Dotel's pitch over the right-field wall for a three-run homer that propelled the Expos to a 5-4 victory over the Astros on Wednesday before 25,535 at Astros Field. ``I didn't want to give him anything good to hit,'' Dotel said. ``That pitch was away, but he's the kind of guy who likes to swing no matter what. He swung, and he got it.'' Again. The homer was Guerrero's second of the night, the first being an amazing solo shot in the fourth inning off Shane Reynolds that Guerrero practically golfed off the dirt and roped into the Crawford Boxes. ``He has an idea of what he's doing up there and what he's looking for,'' said Montreal manager Frank Robinson. ``He just pulled it out. ``That's the problem when you don't want someone to hurt you. I've seen it happen so often over the years in this game. ``You go out there and tell the pitcher, `I'm not second-guessing you, but you're not going to let this guy beat you.' So he's throwing the ball up there but not focusing on really getting him out. ``So you make a mistake, and this guy can hit anything that leaves the pitcher's hand. And he can hit it a long way.'' Which Guerrero proved Wednesday. Again. It was Guerrero's third two-homer game of the season and the 16th two-homer game of his career. Guerrero, who also blasted two homers last Sunday in the Expos' 5-2 victory over St. Louis, has now hit safely in 11 straight games. Guerrero shrugged his thick shoulders when asked about the hot streak. ``It feels real good,'' said Guerrero, who had a team-record 28 RBIs in April. ``I got off to a good start in the first month, and things are going well for the ballclub.'' The first-place Expos, who were discussed as contraction fodder in the offseason, are off to their best start since 1996, when they finished second (88-74) in the National League East. And Guerrero has been the prime mover for Montreal. He got loose in the fourth inning, tattooing a ridiculously low Reynolds curveball into the Crawford Boxes in left field. The hit was so stunning that left fielder Daryle Ward simply froze, watching the ball shoot out of the stadium. ``It's kind of a routine for me _ the pitchers are pitching me tough all the time,'' Guerrero said. ``I'm kind of making the adjustment now.'' Robinson laughed at Guerrero's ability to hit just about anything that is thrown in the approximate direction of home plate. ``It was a curveball, and he went down and got it,'' said Robinson of Reynolds' pitch. ``He's just amazing. The type of pitches, the location of pitches it's amazing. There's no one way to pitch him. ``You can make him look bad on a pitch, but he'll come right back, and the next pitch will be gone. That's what makes him so tough to pitch to. And he's so strong. The ball just flies off his bat.'' When asked if he could recall another bad-ball hitter who even remotely compares to Guerrero, Robinson just shook his head. ``No,'' Robinson said. ``There have have been a couple of guys like a (Roberto) Clemente and Yogi Berra and maybe Manny Sanguillen, but they're not even close to this guy. ``I'm just glad he's mine.''
