The director of the Riverside Church youth basketball program, the prestigious proving ground for dozens of professional players, has left his job amid accusations that he sexually abused a teen-age player nearly 20 years ago. The director, Ernest Lorch, who once headed a Midtown leveraged-buyout firm, stepped down on Monday because the Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating his relationship with the former player, Robert Holmes, officials at the interdenominational church said Tuesday. Lorch, the coach of the program's team, the Riverside Hawks, gave up the directorship pending the resolution of the investigation, a church statement said. In an affidavit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Holmes, 34, said he had been sexually abused by Lorch between the ages of 12 and 15, when he played for the Hawks. Holmes also stated in his affidavit that when he and his mother confronted Lorch with the accusations, Lorch gave him $25,000 _ and later hired lawyers for him in a criminal case at a cost of $250,000 _ ``to seek refuge from his wrongdoings of sexual abuse.'' The district attorney's office would neither confirm nor deny whether it was investigating Lorch, although Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney, said prosecutors had set up a phone number, (212) 335-9373, for anyone with relevant information. Lorch was not available to comment on his decision, which was reported Tuesday in The Daily News. Holmes' affidavit was filed in an effort to reverse his conviction on federal weapons charges in 2000. Holmes, who is serving a 97-month prison term, is trying to revive his case by arguing, in part, that his former lawyers provided him with ineffective counsel by letting Lorch, who hired them, testify. Lorch, 69, is a lawyer and the former chief executive of Dyson-Kissner-Moran. He has been a powerful figure in New York City amateur basketball since taking over the program at Riverside in 1961.
