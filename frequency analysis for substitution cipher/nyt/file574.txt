NBC's daytime lineup has sought out housewives, stay-at-home mothers and children with everything from Arlene's Francis' ``Home'' show, which pioneered women's daytime information programming in the mid '50s, to the shows like Monty Hall's outlandish costume fest, ``Let's Make a Deal.'' (``Do you want the door or the curtain?'') -Kids' shows: Kids in the '50s knew that 5:30 p.m. meant it was ``Howdy Doody'' time. The show, starring Buffalo Bob Smith and his freckled marionette, had such a long waiting list for seats in the studio ``peanut gallery'' that, had all the little hopefuls stood in line, the ones at the back would have been college age by the time their turns came. -Soap operas: NBC never had a significant foothold on the soap-opera market; the still-popular ``Days of Our Lives,'' which debuted in 1965, is the network's only serial to go the distance. Currently it has only one other daytime drama on the air, the quirky newcomer ``Passions.'' -Games: But, boy, could NBC do games. Hugh Downs gave us the phrase `` ... and the board goes back'' on the picture-matching show ``Concentration'' in 1958. Gene Rayburn launched the celebrity-paneled fill-in-the-blank show ``Match Game'' in 1962. In 1964, Art Fleming initiated the still-popular ``Jeopardy!'' format where the question is the answer. Long before Whoopi Goldberg took over the franchise, Peter Marshall in 1966 began placing X's and O's on the ``Hollywood Squares,'' where cackling comic actor Paul Lynde held the choice center position. One of NBC's greatest game show hits ever was ``Queen for a Day,'' which in some respects foreshadowed the daytime talk format of the '90s. On ``Queen,'' four women would take turns telling their grim personal stories of disease, death and poverty to host Jack Bailey. Then the audience, by applause meter, would choose one of them for the tiara, the seat on the throne and a shower of prizes before sending her back to her miserable existence. ``Sure, 'Queen' was vulgar and sleazy and filled with bathos and bad taste,'' producer Howard Blake is quoted in ``The TV Game Show Almanac.'' ``That was why it was so successful.''
