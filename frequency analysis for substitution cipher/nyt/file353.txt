NATO airborne-radar planes that have circled American skies since last fall will return to Europe this month, alliance and Pentagon officials said Wednesday. The arrival of the surveillance planes last October was the first time NATO forces had crossed the Atlantic to defend the United States. They freed Air Force AWACS for missions elsewhere, including near Afghanistan. The redeployment of the five NATO surveillance planes and their European crews comes a month after the Pentagon began reducing the intermittent combat flights over major American cities that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. With fewer Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighters flying patrols, the NATO planes were no longer needed to help manage the flow of military air traffic, Pentagon officials said Wednesday. ``I certainly want to express my full appreciation and the appreciation of our country to our NATO allies,'' Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Wednesday. Since arriving at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma on Oct. 9, the NATO aircraft have flown more than 360 missions, nearly a quarter of all AWACS flights over the United States in that time. Some 830 crew members from 13 allied nations participated in the flights. The NATO AWACS are scheduled to leave the United States on May 16 for their base at Geilenkirchen, Germany. Air Force AWACS based at Tinker will continue to fly surveillance missions. Pentagon officials said stricter airport security, stronger cockpit doors and more federal marshals on flights had reduced the threat of attacks enough to allow the military to scale back the combat air patrols that the AWACS helped direct. Since Sept. 11, the patrols have cost $50 million a week and tied up about 11,000 Air Force personnel and 250 fighters, refueling and airborne-radar planes. Air Force and Navy aircraft have flown more than 21,000 flights since Sept. 11 to ensure the safety of the nation's skies.
