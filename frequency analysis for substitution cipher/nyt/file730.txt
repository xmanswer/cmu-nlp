As the funeral cortege for Lisa Lopes pulled into the cemetery Thursday, cries of disappointment rang out from a group of about 200 fans. The fans _ mothers with children and baby carriages as well as older folks wielding umbrellas in the punishing mid-afternoon sun _ were upset because a heavy police presence had blocked their view of Lopes' grave site. ``People want to see the stars,'' Donna Reddick, 46, said. ``That's why these folks are gathered here.'' Leonard Kenyon placed a blue baseball cap over his heart and disputed that notion. ``I feel like there's a part of me over there,'' he said. ``This ain't no hoopla. This ain't no show. This is just love.'' That mix of sentiments _ the allure of a celebrity mingled with an ability to get ordinary people to identify with her _ is what defined Lopes' appeal in life. That theme is also what characterized the reaction of fans who gathered to say goodbye to a woman who seemed to embody being ``crazy, sexy and cool.'' Fans talked about Lopes not just as a glamorous figure but as an old friend. ``I've been though some tough times in my life, and her raps have helped me,'' said Jarred Crower, 16, after attending her wake Wednesday night. (The wake was private, but fans still came.) ``Lisa's raps were inspirational, especially her rap on 'Waterfalls,' '' Crower said. ``She was saying to young people, 'Don't just give your life up to anything.' Adults don't like gangsta rap, but Left Eye's raps were different.'' Tiara Rolle, 15, said she saw a parallel between Lopes' death and the death of the singer Aaliyah eight months ago. ``They were two different people, but they have the same message to young people: 'Be positive and have goals.' Lisa had a unique voice. She was real, and she didn't hide who she was.'' The funeral also attracted plenty of the late singer's younger fans. Anthony Nelson of Stone Mountain, Ga., said he felt those fans had to be there for such an important event. ``I'm supposed to be in school,'' Nelson, 17, said. ``But (Lopes) inspired me in so many different ways, I had to come.'' The most memorable part of the service, Nelson said, came when Wanda Lopes, Lisa's mother, stepped to the front of the church. ``When her mom went up there and read her poem _ Oh, I tried to hold it all in,'' he said. Betty Smith, 35, of Lithonia, Ga., said she was especially moved when the Rev. Bernice King was asked to come to the front. Smith said she felt for a moment as if King's own celebrated father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., were there. ``I'm sure she touched a lot of people.'' Durea Rupert, 35, of Mableton, Ga., found herself thinking of beginnings, not endings, at the funeral. And her own mortality. ``Death doesn't have a name on it,'' Rupert said.
