(Malone/Moscoso, Cox News Service) NUKEPLANT-ATTACK _ WASHINGTON _ In his State of the Union speech, President Bush talked about the vulnerbilities of the nation's nuclear facilities. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has strongly urged the states to increase security at nuclear plants. But earlier this week, Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), the chairman of the subcommittee on terrorism said, ``the likelihood of an attack on a nuclear plant that allows it to emanate and distribute nuclear waste is not nearly as serious as what a lot of folks make it out to be.'' His comments are rankling lawmakers on Capitol Hill who believe that nuclear safety should be a top priority. They are dismayed that the White House nixed a request from Secretary of Energy for $380 million to improve security.

You got a problem with that? ``It's better than cigarettes and drugs and adultery,'' says the father of three. Fowler doesn't hide his habit from his fiancee or his children. It's the rest of society that belittles comics as fodder for kids and geeky collectors.
