In what some may consider an unlikely setting for a fighter training for any fight, let alone the heavyweight championship of the world, Mike Tyson is preparing here in Maui for his June 8 bout in Memphis with the titleholder, Lennox Lewis. Tyson is training in a gym not far from the Haleakala volcano, which before Iron Mike showed up was the lone volcano on this lush, splendiferous island. In a hotel suite crowded with about 20 journalists from around the world, Tyson agreed to hold one of his few interviews before the fight. In a discussion that lasted about 1 hour 15 minutes, Tyson, sometimes charming, sometimes bullying, dealt with a mind-spinning array of topics: Machiavelli (he's reading the book ``Machiavelli in Hell''); the morality _ or lack of it _ of religious leaders; and even Lennox Lewis. Tyson is famous, and infamous, for his volatile eruptions, a long list that includes street fights; road rage; smashing crystal in hotels; biting the ears of Evander Holyfield in a title bout; and a three-year prison sentence for rape. Haleakala is dormant, and so was Tyson on Tuesday afternoon, but history tells us that he seethes. Tyson agreed with that assessment, saying, as he often has, that his growing up as a ``dog guy from the den of iniquity'' in Brownsville, Brooklyn, among other reasons, has produced the mercurial person he is today. At one point Tuesday afternoon, Tyson was asked if this fight was going to be won by mind over matter. Tyson smiled. ``His mind's not going to hit my mind,'' he said. ``I'm going to be professional but I'm going to try to kill him. We're brothers, and you have to love your brother. But I know he sure wants to kill me, and I sure want to kill him.'' And how did he wind up in Maui to train? ``I don't know how I got here,'' he said. ``I came here one time with my second wife and didn't have a good time. I didn't want to be married.'' He is now in divorce proceedings with that wife, Monica. ``I'm having a good time now,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean I'm not training hard.'' Tyson recalled that when he was a teen-ager and living with Cus D'Amato, his manager and trainer, he liked to play around. ``Cus told me, `If you do that, then you have to train three times as hard as you normally would.''' Tyson said. ``Well, I'm not playing nearly that hard, but I'm still training three times as hard as I normally would.'' Tyson, who turns 36 on June 30, is trying to regain the title he first won at 20 in 1986, when he became the youngest heavyweight champion ever. ``I've been fighting for about 25 years,'' he said, ``and I basically know what I have to do to get ready for this fight. I'm in great shape, and will get into even better shape, and I have to be hungry and determined.'' He was asked if he had any nightmares about losing. ``Losing?'' he said. ``It's impossible. It doesn't even cross my mind.'' Of Machiavelli, Tyson said he was cool. Machiavelli was an Italian statesman in the 16th century who wrote the primer on the ends justifying the means. ``I'm a bad guy,'' Tyson said. ``But if I was a good guy, nobody would want to pay to see me fight.'' On one hand, he said, he likes his reputation for being unpredictable and ``an animal.'' On the other hand, he said he had received bad press. He also said he could have been like Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan, playing a kind of game for the public. ``But that's not me,'' he said. ``I'm a lot of people in one, but I'm not going to be someone that other people want me to be. ``I can't help it who I am.'' His conversation journeyed from self-love (``I'm honest about who I am, not like some of those reverends like Jimmy Baker or Jimmy Swaggart, or those priests'') to self-hate. ``I wake up every morning and hate myself,'' he said. ``I don't have any dignity left. I lost my dignity in prison. So I don't care how the public feels about me. Love me or hate me. Don't care.'' He spoke about his brother, Rodney, ``about five or six years older than me,'' who was a pharmacist's assistant and, Tyson said, is now an assistant to a brain surgeon in California. ``We're totally different people, and always have been,'' Tyson said. ``Rodney's brilliant, and he was embarrassed in how we grew up and wanted to separate himself from that, and from the way I was. ``But we're friends now, not close, but friends. And we took two different paths in life. I scramble people's brains, and he fixes 'em.''
