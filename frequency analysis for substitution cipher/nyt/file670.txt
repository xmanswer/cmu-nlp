At an autograph session this week, a fan told Woody Allen he loves his movies _ even the ones he hates. ``I thanked the guy,'' the 66-year-old writer-director-actor said in his first visit to Atlanta Tuesday to promote his comedy ``Hollywood Ending,'' opening today. ``That, to me, is one of the biggest compliments. I don't mind that I strike out and you don't like the film, or I made a bad film. But at least if I get the credit for not taking the middle-of-the-road approach or selling out, that's fine with me.'' No one's calling the Woodman a sell-out. He's continued to work at his film-a-year pace a decade after his messy custody fight with Mia Farrow and his marriage five years ago to her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. But it's been a long time since he's had a true critical hit like ``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' His latest film is little more than cinematic meringue, the third of three comic piffles that began with ``Small Time Crooks.'' Yet the publicity-shy New Yorker nonetheless seems to be everywhere lately _ visiting _ for the first time _ cities like Austin, Toronto and Atlanta to promote his film. In person, he's funny, thoughtful and engaging, but at times sounds as hermetically sealed as his recent movies feel. The longtime Hollywood critic made a surprise appearance at this year's Academy Awards to introduce a montage of films made in New York, and ``plead'' for other directors to shoot there. Appearing in support of the still-recovering city he loves, Allen admits he was surprised by the standing ovation he received. ``I've always been so critical of the Academy Awards and I'm not an Academy member. I've always teased California mercilessly in jokes and movies. But the audience was very warm and very friendly, and they laughed at the jokes.'' Another first-time event: He's agreed to attend the Cannes Film Festival, where his new movie will be the opening night presentation on May 15. ``The French have been very, very supportive of me and very affectionate,'' he says. ``They've invited me for 25 years now, and I always said no. So I wanted to reciprocate once and not be so standoffish.'' A couple of things worry him, though. ``All I hear from people about Cannes is that it's a total madhouse, and I'm a little apprehensive about it,'' he says, suddenly sounding more like one of the neurotic nebbishes he plays onscreen. While at Cannes, he won't watch the film. He never watches any of his movies after they're finished. ``It's like a chef who's worked in the kitchen all day,'' he explains. ``You don't want to eat the lobster thermidor.'' (Does anybody but the Woodster still eat lobster thermidor?) Unlike other stars, in person Allen looks exactly as he does onscreen: slight and tweedy, with bald spots among unruly tufts of gray. His school-donnish herringbone blazer could be a costume, and maybe it is: He wears his own clothes in his movies. The last five years have brought big changes. In 1997, he married Previn, the fulcrum of one of show-biz's nastiest breakups. During a custody trial for their three children, Farrow accused Allen of molesting adopted daughter Dylan, though he was cleared of all charges. The director hasn't spoken to his 14-year-old biological son by Farrow, originally named Satchel but now called Seamus, for several years. ``I was allowed to by the court,'' he says. ``but Mia made it very difficult, so no.'' When his relationship with Previn made news in 1992, he didn't worry that his career was kaput. ``I never had a moment's doubt. For me, it was a matter for lawyers to handle.'' So he did what he always does: focused on the next movie, ``Manhattan Murder Mystery,'' in which he re-cast old flame Diane Keaton in the role planned for Farrow. Other changes: He switched film distributors, from Miramax to DreamWorks, which ushered in this new era of accessibility. Also, he he sued longtime friend Jean Doumanian, who produced eight of his movies beginning with ``Bullets Over Broadway,'' and her partner in Sweetland Films for shortchanging him $10 million in profits. Doumanian and Jacqui Safra began financing Allen's pictures after his deal with TriStar fell apart in the wake of the Farrow split. Safra reportedly decided to stop funding Allen after the poor box office for ``Sweet and Lowdown.'' Allen hooked up with DreamWorks, then filed suit last summer; the case is due in court this month. What hasn't changed in Allen's life is his methodical work schedule and an artistic freedom no other American director enjoys. Because his films cost a pittance compared to Hollywood titles (``Ending'' was made for $16 million), he doesn't lose time raising a budget. ``In my financial deal (with DreamWorks), I pull the script out of the typewriter, call up my production manager, and in 15 minutes I'm in production,'' he says. One key to low overhead is the flat rate Allen pays his stars. ``We pay $5,000 a week, no more than that to anybody,'' he says. ``I have to catch the actors between lucrative jobs to get them.'' He doesn't always get the stars he wants. ``Dustin Hoffman could play the same part that I'm playing in a movie, and a hundred times better,'' he says. ``I've tried on a couple of occasions to get him, but the guy is always busy.'' Likewise, he offered Jack Nicholson the Oscar-winning role Michael Caine played in ``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' But Nicholson was committed to ``Prizzi's Honor.'' Allen feels the fact that most of his films have been comedies has discouraged executives from tinkering with his early scripts: ``Comedy directors might have it easier because noncreative people feel that if they read a dramatic script they can make suggestions, it's in their ballpark. But jokes and comedic things are too foreign to them, too exotic. It's a rarer gift.'' By his fifth film, ``Love and Death,'' he contractually had full artistic control. He doesn't have to submit to test screenings or studio meetings about demographics, a trend he feels has trashed American film standards. ``There used to be a reasonable diet of good American films,'' he says. ``Now they're few and far between.'' When asked to name recent favorites, he realized they were all foreign titles. Allen's legion of fans has shrunk, but they remain loyal. Still, his films raise a couple of common complaints. For one, the very Caucasian New York of his movies doesn't reflect the city's diversity. ``The implication behind it is that I'm deliberately excluding people, which of course is absurd,'' he says. ``I'm an extreme Democratic liberal. I marched with Martin Luther King on Washington and I was always in favor of black aggressiveness. I do believe in affirmative action, but I have to cast the part as I see it in my mind's eye.'' Another source of criticism is his choice of romantic leads decades his junior, like ``Ending's'' Tea Leoni, 36. ``My feeling is, that's the way the ball bounces,'' he says. ``If the person doesn't like that, then they're free not to come and see the movie.'' After all, he points out, his own wife is five years younger than Leoni. It's the sort of non-answer that recalls his famous, evasive rationale for his attraction to Previn: ``The heart wants what it wants.'' Though she's nowhere to be seen when he's doing interviews at the Four Seasons, his wife and their two young adoptive daughters accompany him everywhere he travels. Allen was excited about taking them Thursday to another city they'd never seen, Savannah. ``I only hear wonderful things about it and I'm dying to see it.'' Despite the public breakup and legal issues, he considers his life charmed. ``I must say, I've been very lucky. I was lucky in my career. I'm very happily married, the kids are wonderful. My health has held out very well, and my parents had remarkable longevity.'' His folks, Martin and Nettie Konigsberg, died last year _ his father at 100, his mother, 96. Allen hopes he shares their good genetics: ``That would be great, because then I could see my kids grow up a little bit and continue to work. It doesn't have to be in films. They can pull the plug on me any time and say, `We don't want to fund your films any more.' I would be very happy writing for the theater or doing books or something. It would be very pleasurable.''

RECENT FILMS HE'S LIKED: ``You Can Count on Me,'' ``Election,'' ``Flirting With Disaster,'' ``Wonder Boys,'' ``The Taste of Others,'' ``Butterfly,'' ``Amores Perros,'' ``Kandahar,'' ``Y Tu Mama Tambien.'' NEXT: ``Anything Else,'' starring Jason Biggs, Christina Ricci, Danny DeVito, Glenn Close and Allen, starts shooting June 3. Unlike his last three movies, based on comic premises, ``it's a much more serious comedy,'' he says. ``It's more in the nature of ``Manhattan' or `Husbands and Wives' or `Annie Hall.' It's based on characters and the neurotic interaction of the characters.'' Story Filed By Cox Newspapers
