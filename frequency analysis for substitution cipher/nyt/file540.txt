NBC had a longtime predisposition toward daring programming decisions, especially in comedy. -``Your Show of Shows'' (1949-54), headlined by Sid Caesar, was sometimes described as ``tightrope television'' because of its live format, multiple sketches and improvisation demands, such demands providing training for many great comedy writers, including Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Neil Simon. -``Rowan &AMP; Martin's Laugh-In'' (1967-73) started as a throwaway show, a cheaply produced special to air after the Miss America pageant. The following January it was back, in what producer George Schlatter called the ``kamikaze time period'' of 8 p.m. Mondays opposite CBS powerhouses ``Gunsmoke'' and ``The Lucy Show.'' Somehow the one-of-a-kind comedy show -- with snippet-size sketches, star cameos, trap doors and ``sock it to me'' splashes -- got noticed. Some viewers loved it, while others were appalled by its irreverence. Schlatter admits to a cheeky defiance in his dealings with the network brass. When one executive complained that Goldie Hawn muffed too many lines, Schlatter deliberately inverted words on her cue cards and had other cast members make faces at her to assure Hawn would mess up and giggle. He also purposely included raunchy, objectionable material without expecting it to make it on the air. ``A lot of it was put in there to surrender so we could keep something else,'' he said. ``Standards &AMP; Practices -- the censors -- were a major, major problem.'' -``The Flip Wilson Show'' (1970-74) kicked drag comedy up a notch with Wilson's signature character, the sassy, sexy Geraldine. -``Sanford &AMP; Son,'' (1972-77) was the first widely appealing, truly ethnic situation comedy series, followed two seasons later by ``Chico and the Man'' (1974-78). -``Taxi'' (1982-83) was a series the network showed great faith in with an ensemble cast and writing staff. ``Taxi'' was snagged from ABC's rejects pile after four seasons and given another chance. (It lasted one more year.) -``Family Ties'' (1982-89), ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air'' (1990-96) and ``Mad About You'' (1992-99) groomed future movie stars Michael J. Fox, Will Smith and Helen Hunt. -``The Cosby Show'' (1984-92) brought back the family-oriented series and jump-started the half-hour format. It allowed ``Cheers'' (1982-93) and ``Seinfeld'' (1990-98) to grow their audiences and was rewarded with consistently high ratings in the long run.
