So here we are again, at the end of one race and the beginning of another. Endings first: when the curtain fell on the opening night of ``The Man Who Had All the Luck'' at the American Airlines Theater on Wednesday, it was the end of Tony eligibility for the 2001-02 season, concluding a year when Broadway swooned _ and rallied _ as never before. At the same time, it signified the beginning of what promises to be one of the most interesting Tony contests in several years. The first challenge is just being nominated. While their commercial value is debatable, nominations are always a morale boost. Everybody wants nominations, and some shows really need them. A handful closed within a week of last year's nominations announcement. This year there are several, like the nicely reviewed but weak-selling revival of ``The Elephant Man,'' that could use some peer approval to help spur sales. Who wields the power to nominate? Twenty-eight theater professionals from diverse backgrounds, ranging from oldtimers like the opening night snapshot artist Aubrey Reuben to relative babes like the actor and playwright David Marshall Grant. They will meet Sunday. So here are the results of an informal and totally unscientific survey about what may be revealed when Jennifer Jason Leigh (of ``Proof'') and Steven Weber (of ``The Producers'') read the nominations on Monday morning at 8:30 at Sardi's. BEST MUSICAL _ Opinion has coalesced around four shows: ``Mamma Mia!,'' the smash Abba spectacle; ``Urinetown,'' the scrappy downtown transfer; ``Throughly Modern Millie,'' the perky adaptation of the perky 1967 film; and ``Sweet Smell of Success,'' the grainy adaptation of the grainy 1957 film. The hopes of the other three _ ``By Jeeves,'' ``One Mo' Time'' and ``Thou Shalt Not'' _ were buried by bad reviews. The nominations, however, are just the start of one of the tightest Tony races for best musical in years. (``The Producers,'' you'll recall, was something of a favorite last year.) ``Sweet Smell'' isn't considered a strong contender, but any of the other three could feasibly take it. Each has a hurdle, however: ``Urinetown'' will have to overcome its title and fringe status, ``Millie'' has to overcome its mixed reviews and ``Mamma Mia!'' needs to overcome its feather-light constitution. However it goes, it should be fun to watch. BEST PLAY _ The Outer Critics Circle awards, like the film world's Golden Globes, are selected by out-of-town critics and often reflect Tony thinking. Their nominees were ``Metamorphoses,'' ``The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?,'' ``Fortune's Fool'' and ``Topdog/Underdog.'' (``Fortune's Fool,'' the Turgenev play dating to 1848, was designated as a new play on Thursday by the Tony eligibility committee because it had never been produced on Broadway.) Expect the Tony nominations to be similar to those of the the Outer Critics, who announced their winners on Tuesday. But they chose ``The Goat'' as the best play. Most on Broadway don't expect the same on Tony night, June 2. BEST MUSICAL REVIVAL _ There are only two possibilities _ ``Into the Woods'' and ``Oklahoma!'' _ and both are guaranteed to be nominated. This race is going to be dandy. Neither show got raves. Both are composed by musical theater legends, and both are produced by outfits with big egos and deep pockets (``Oklahoma!'' by Cameron Mackintosh, ``Into the Woods'' by Dodger Theatricals and the Dutch producer Joop van den Ende, among others). BEST PLAY REVIVAL _ Except for best actor in a play, this is the most competitive category for nominations. With the opening of ``The Man Who Had All the Luck'' on Wednesday, there are 11 contenders for a mere four slots, a situation made worse by the fact that many of the play revivals received favorable reviews. Two shows that opened late in the season to good notices, ``Morning's at Seven'' and ``Private Lives,'' look strong, as does ``The Crucible,'' one of two Arthur Miller revivals. (``The Man ... '' is the other.) That leaves one slot. ``Hedda Gabler'' and ``Dance of Death'' are at a disadvantage since they have closed. It's tight, but ``Noises Off,'' the most overt comedy of the season, has the edge over ``The Elephant Man,'' which has been struggling despite great write-ups for its star, Billy Crudup. LEADING ACTOR IN A PLAY _ Liam Neeson, Crudup, Bill Pullman, Jeffrey Wright, Ian McKellan, Chris O'Donnell, Alan Bates, Alan Rickman, Mos Def, Kevin Bacon: all gave acclaimed performances this year, and 10 of them are not going to fit in a category that holds only 5. Look for the British to get two nods (Bates and Rickman), the Irish one (Neeson), and the Americans two (Pullman and Wright). Crudup, O'Donnell, Sir Ian, Bacon and Mos Def, all richly deserving, will miss the boat. LEADING ACTRESS IN A PLAY _ As always, there weren't enough meaty roles for leading actresses on Broadway this year, but the roles there were were well filled. Lindsay Duncan is a shoo-in for ``Private Lives,'' as is Helen Mirren for ``Dance of Death.'' Laura Linney will be noticed for ``The Crucible,'' and Kate Burton will be remembered for ``Hedda Gabler.'' The final nominee looks to be Mercedes Ruehl, for ``The Goat.'' LEADING ACTOR IN A MUSICAL _ Not a great year, but admirable efforts by three Johns (Lithgow of ``Sweet Smell,'' McMartin of ``Into the Woods'' and Cullum of ``Urinetown'') and a Curly (Patrick Wilson of ``Oklahoma!'') seem likely. Hunter Foster, of ``Urinetown,'' could be the fifth. LEADING ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL _ Hunter's sister, Sutton Foster (``Throughly Modern Millie''), looks good in this category. She will be joined by Louise Pitre (``Mamma Mia!''), Vanessa Williams (``Into the Woods'') and perhaps Nancy Opel of ``Urinetown.'' FEATURED ROLES _ One of the joys of nomination day comes when the little-known actor gets the big-time nod. This year Norbert Leo Butz (``Thou Shalt Not'') and Spencer Kayden (``Urinetown'') should fill the roles of Nominated Newcomers. Other musical nominees are likely to include Kerry O'Malley and Laura Benanti, two from ``Into the Woods''; and Marc Kudisch from ``Millie''; and Brian D'Arcy James from ``Sweet Smell.'' Other worthy nominees are likely to include Stephen Tobolowsky (``Morning's at Seven'') for featured actor in a play, where he'll probably be joined by heavyweights like David Warner (``Major Barbara'') and Frank Langella (``Fortune's Fool''). Among actresses in plays, some from ``Morning's at Seven'' are likely to pick up a couple of nominations. There are also already two early favorites for winners in supporting categories: Katie Finneran (``Noises Off''), for featured actress in a play, and Shuler Hensley (``Oklahoma!''), for featured actor in a musical.
