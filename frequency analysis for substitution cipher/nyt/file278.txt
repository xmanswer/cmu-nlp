Bernard J. Ebbers, who resigned under pressure over the weekend as president and chief executive of WorldCom, has been given the ceremonial title of chairman emeritus, according to John Sidgmore, his successor. Ebbers moved out of WorldCom's headquarters in Clinton, Miss., to an office in nearby Jackson after resigning, Sidgmore said. Worldcom said it has agreed to give Ebbers five years to repay $366 million in loans, which carry a 2.5 percent interest rate.
