There's a cozy glow from the night light, stuffed animals are in their place, bed covers are tucked just so, and Mom or Dad snuggles companionably. Nothing could feel more safe, more secure. No wonder bedtime is often when a child is likely to share the secrets of his heart. So what if the secret is about how he's perfected his slide into third base or her plan for tomorrow's jump-rope contest. For children, intimacy is as much about connection as it is about content. Bedtime works like magic, but so can car time, when it's just the two of you, or chore time, when you're working at something side by side. Lack of eye contact has something to do with it. ``It's easier for children to say something that's scary or embarrassing or painful when we aren't looking them in the eye,'' says child psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan of George Washington University Medical School and author of ``Building Healthy Minds.'' His newest book, ``The Secure Child'' (Perseus), is due out in May. The side-by-side-ness helps, too. Children tend to talk when they're in the middle of doing other things. Greenspan advocates ``floor time'' and hang-out time: getting down on the floor with toddlers, joining in the pretend play of preschoolers, plopping onto the bed of a preteen, stopping by a teenager's room to listen to his music. These unstructured times are like neon signs that tell your child, ``I'm available. I'm interested. Try me.'' This is all part of the groundwork for having an intimate emotional relationship with your child. ``It takes time and trust,'' says parent educator Adele Faber. ``You can't bake a cake in two minutes and you can't expect instant intimacy.'' A child needs to feel what he says will be welcome. That doesn't mean hanging on his every word; not only would that be too much attention for most children, it would also be torturous for parents with very chatty children. Most children, however, have a time of day when they are likely to open up, not just talk. Figure out when it is, ritualize it, and protect it from intrusion, says child psychologist Ron Taffel, who lectures nationally on parenting issues. He is author of ``Parenting by Heart, How to stay connected to your child in a disconnected world, Revised Edition'' (Perseus). When parents think of intimate conversations, we tend to think of the big three: sex, death, God. These topics come up repeatedly in various ways at various stages of development and we need to be prepared for them, says Greenspan. He tells parents, however, that ``true intimacy is tuning in to another person's mind, wherever it is.'' Children's minds are often on the mundane, but it takes only one nugget to get you from mundane to meaningful. ``It's the mundane that will open the door to where you need to go to share feelings,'' says Taffel. Unfortunately, parents often slam the door shut without even knowing it. ``A child of any age needs to feel she can bring up any subject without being jumped on with questions, criticisms, judgments, or even loving disapprovals such as, `Oh, don't be silly, honey, of course you have friends,' '' says Faber. ``They need to know they can share their innermost thoughts without us trampling on them.'' She says that when a child raises a dilemma or question of any sort, ``he's already thought about it some. He's bringing it to you because he wants a chance to explore it together. Sometimes, parents are too anxious to take the pain away. The search for an answer can be as important as the answer.'' Family therapist Jessica Gillooly of Glendale, Calif., says children of all ages long to talk to a parent about their deep feelings and to hear a parent talk about theirs. That's partly because it's too much for them to hold all their thoughts to themselves, and partly because, in the aftermath of sharing, there's a glow from feeling mutually understood. Gillooly is author of a book about one of the most intimate subjects for girls, ``Before she gets her period'' (Perspective Publishing). She also has an essay about parent-child intimacy in ``Parent School'' (Evans), edited by Jerry and Lorin Biederman. Paving the way for intimacy begins even when our children are infants, because we are shaping our attitudes and approaches. ``When you pick up a crying baby, do you say, `There, there, there's nothing to cry about,' or, `What's making my sweetie so unhappy?' '' asks Faber. She is co-author of ``How to Talk So Kids Will Listen &AMP; Listen So Kids Will Talk'' (Harper Collins), now in it's 20th anniversary edition. Whether you're snuggling next to your child at bedtime or washing the car side by side, here are some things to consider: Avoid over-reacting. Parents who go overboard typically are either hand-wringers, screamers, or ``Here's-what-to-do'' know-it-alls. A diet of the first erodes a child's judgment (``I knew it was bad,'' he'll say to himself, ``but is it really that bad?''); the second can diminish a child and even frighten him; while the third robs her of the opportunity to develop problem-solving skills. ``Don't be afraid of having an honest, human reaction,'' says Taffel: `` `I can't believe kids can be so mean to each other!' '' Then repeat back a little bit of what he's said in your own words, to show that you understand, says Faber. Summarize in the form of a question: ``This is really tricky, isn't it? I can see why you're struggling/worried/upset.'' Silence is OK, too. ``It's in silence that original thoughts grow,'' she says. It's also OK to leave the room without solving the problem. ``Children need to explore their ambivalence and ambiguities. That takes time,'' she says. Avoid under-reacting. Saying nothing, or, ``Hmmmm,'' can leave a child feeling unsupported. A statement like, ``That must have made you really angry. . .'' can sometimes be helpful but, depending on your tone or how frequently you say it, can sound semi-therapeutic, inauthentic, and underwhelming. Then there's body language. ``When parents hear something that makes us anxious, there's a tendency to physically withdraw'' to shore ourselves up, says Greenspan. ``Your voice might change, your body tenses up, you change the subject. Those are all ways of pulling away.'' They come across as disapproving, causing a child to tense up and withdraw, too. Try instead to offer a pat or a glance that conveys understanding and warmth. ``Even just the rhythm of your voice can be soothing, even that you haven't moved away,'' says Greenspan. Don't interrupt. When Taffel asked children around the country, ``What keeps you from talking to your parents more,'' the overwhelming answer was, ``They interrupt too much.'' When parents ask questions, it's typically to meet our own needs, to assuage our anxiety or get better information faster. It comes across, however, as intrusive and hostile. ``Children freeze up and withdraw because we're taking control away from them,'' Greenspan says. ``This is, after all, their story.'' If you must ask a question, stay away from ``Why?'' and ``When?'' and try, ``What happened next?'' That's more likely to move the narrative along, says Taffel, and to get the child where you want him to go: to the feelings.'' Even that question can be annoying, however. Getting any child to open up is a matter of trial and error. Taffel urges parents not to give up. ``If you realize you've made a mistake, say so to any age child but especially to a teenager,'' he says: `` `I realize I interrupt too much. I'm going to try really hard not to do that anymore. I hope you'll give me another chance.' '' Also, just because you have a pre-teen or teenager who has outgrown getting tucked in doesn't mean that now and then you can't go into her room after the light is out, ask her if it's OK to sit on the bed, and offer to rub her back. ``You can even say that you miss the nights when you used to sit and talk,'' says Gillooly. ``Don't expect something to happen the first night. There may even be nights when you get rebuffed or where there's just silence. But then one night, well, you never know.'' The magic may just return.
