Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday that television shows including ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and ``CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' have saved several thousands of dollars through the state's ``Film California First'' rebate incentive program. The program, administered by the California Film Commission since last year, is aimed at keeping productions local by rebating the costs of public labor -- excluding police -- and reducing location site fees when filming on public property. Productions can obtain up to $300,000 in rebates on a project. A growing number of television shows -- including several with California settings -- has migrated to other countries where production costs are cheaper including such embarrassing situations as having a show called ``Pasadena'' actually being filmed in Canada which doubled for, well, Pasadena. In a statement, the governor said he was encouraged by the interest so far in the state program. ```Film California First' gives us the competitive edge in attracting this great array of television shows,'' Davis said. ``We are pleased to have so many episodic television series make their home in California.'' CBS' top-rated ``CSI'' received $24,000 in rebates, primarily for fire safety and transportation services. Fox's ``Malcolm'' received almost $9,000 in rebates. Among the other shows that saved costs include: the WB's ``Charmed,'' which received over $34,000 for fire safety, transportation and pyrotechnics; UPN's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' which was reimbursed a total of $31,000 in costs this season for filming in Griffith Park, Torrance and at William Davis Memorial Park in Altadena; and Fox's ``The X Files,'' which has received more than $170,000 in rebates since the program was launched last year. Other shows that have applied for rebates include Fox's ``Bernie Mac'' ($12,000) and CBS's ``The Guardian'' ($11,000). ``It's exciting that the program helps television producers both film in California and invest in their project,'' said Karen Constine, director of the state's film commission. ``We are pleased to be working with such highly-acclaimed shows.''
