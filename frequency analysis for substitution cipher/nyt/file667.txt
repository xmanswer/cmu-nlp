``Hollywood Ending,'' Woody Allen's latest comedy, is a film-industry satire that will open the prestigious Cannes Film Festival on May 15. The event marks Allen's first appearance at Cannes, where his films ``Manhattan,'' ``The Purple Rose of Cairo'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' have been presented. ``Hollywood Ending'' will be shown out of competition. Allen wrote, directed and stars in the romantic comedy as Val Waxman, a two-time Oscar winner who has been reduced to filming deodorant commercials in Canada. The neurotic director is given his big shot at a comeback by his ex-wife (Tea Leoni), who dumped him for the studio head (Treat Williams) bankrolling the $60 million picture. But the day before shooting is to begin, Val loses his sight. Fearing that he will never work again, he hides his psychosomatic ailment and attempts to direct the movie blind. ``Hollywood Ending'' features a number of witty one-liners, but the broad humor is more in Allen's slapstick vein, ``reducing the material to a series of sight gags _ pun intended _ and lame physical comedy,'' according to the Hollywood Reporter. Variety said the film has funny moments, ``but too much of the picture is flat, dispiriting and frankly unbelievable in fundamental ways that defy the granting of poetic license.'' Buck up, Woodman _ at least they love you in France. ``Deuces Wild'' has been sitting on the shelf for so long that its 1950s fashions probably were in style back when often-delayed, teen-age gang drama was filmed. Set in 1958 Brooklyn, N.Y., the greaser drama stars Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro and Fairuza Balk. It concerns a gang war between the Deuces and the Vipers, as the Deuces attempt to shield their neighborhood from the rising influence of drugs, guns and ``wiseguys.'' ``Director Scott Kalvert shoots the fight scenes as if he were staging a literal head-bangers ball, with lots of loud music, fog machines, thunder and lightning,'' said the Los Angeles Times. ``The only thing missing in all of the choppy slow-motion shots and quick edits is a sense of competence, which would at least have kept ``Deuces'' from plumbing the depths of unintentional comedy.'' ``Italian for Beginners'' is a warm, if stately paced, romantic comedy from Denmark about six lonely singles in their 30s whose lives intersect one bleak Copenhagen winter when they enroll in an introductory Italian-language class. The film was written and directed by Lone Scherfig according to the spartan doctrine of Dogma 95 collective, using natural lighting, muted cinematography and a partially-improvised script. The lightest and most accessible of the Dogma films, it won the Jury Prize at the 2000 Berlin Film Festival and the Public Prize at the 2001 Paris Film Festival. ``Italian for Beginners'' ends up in Venice, ``and, believe it or not, these melancholy Danes create something sweetly sexy, funny and touching,'' said Rolling Stone's Peter Travers.
