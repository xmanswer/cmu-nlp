The awards just keep on coming for Mavericks teammates Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash. Less than three months after playing in their first All-Star Game, Nowitzki and Nash were named Wednesday to the All-NBA team. Nowitzki was named to the second team and Nash earned third-team honors. Last year Nowitzki became the first member of the Mavericks chosen to any All-NBA team when he was a third-team selection. Moving up one level shows that the writers and broadcasters who voted are aware of his talent and ability to take over a game. ``That's awesome,'' said Nowitzki, who averaged 23.4 points and 9.9 rebounds this season. ``It's a great honor for me, being third team last year and moving up. ``It's showing me that I'm getting respect and I improved a lot this year. Hopefully, I can improve more next summer and come back even stronger.'' Nash averaged 17.9 points and 7.7 assists and shot 45.5 percent from 3-point range this season while directing an offense that set a franchise record with 57 victories. ``I'm very proud of both of those guys,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said. ``I wish Mike [Finley] would have made it, too.'' NELSON A BIBBY FAN _ As coaches go, Don Nelson used to cringe when he would see former Sacramento Kings point guard Jason Williams make wild behind-the-back passes that ended up in the seats. Especially when they came at critical moments. Thus, when the Kings executed a trade last summer that sent Williams to the Memphis Grizzlies for Mike Bibby, Nelson was happy for the Kings. ``I've been applauding them all year on making that move,'' Nelson said. ``Bibby is just a wonderful all-around basketball player, and he was one of their best players in their first \Rplayoff\S series \Ragainst Utah\S. ``He gives them more consistency, less errors. I think he's really good for their team.'' Bibby averaged 13.7 points and five assists per game this season as the Kings compiled the best record in the NBA (61-21) and gained homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. BRIEFLY: -- Guard Michael Finley left practice early Wednesday after he turned and felt a ``twinge'' in the upper area of his back. Team officials said the injury is nothing serious, and they expect Finley to practice today. -- Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is featured in this week's edition of ``ESPN The Magazine'' under the headline, ``Stark Raving Mav.'' -- Mavericks assistant general manager Keith Grant went to Chicago to watch Chinese star Yao Ming work out on Wednesday for NBA representatives. -- Forward Eduardo Najera said his left thigh bruise is not giving him any more problems. nn
