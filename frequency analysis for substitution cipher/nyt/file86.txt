DRIVING SIMULATOR 	DRIVING-SIMULATOR-DISCOVER _ The drunken. The drugged. The drowsy. Ginger Watson puts them behind the wheel of her Chevy Malibu every day and then sets them loose in traffic. Fortunately, the danger is purely virtual. The Chevy Malibu is located in a huge driving simulator. Watson, director of the Human Factors Laboratory at the National Advanced Driving Simulator, can test any driver in the most awful scenario imaginable. The top simulator in the world, owned by DaimlerChrysler in Berlin, is mounted on a track about 20 feet long and adds motion to a virtual experience: Hit its brakes hard, and the cab shoots backward, throwing the driver forward into the steering wheel. When the National Advanced Driving Simulator became operational in January, it put the German machine in the shade. A report. By Sam Hooper Samuels.

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS 	THE-PERFECT-LENS-DISCOVER _ ``Every day you play with the light of the universe,'' wrote Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Physicist David R. Smith of the University of California at San Diego takes those words to heart. He spends his days contemplating how to bend light in ways that reverse the normal patterns of refraction. Smith and a handful of like-minded researchers are now building mirror-image materials that could ultimately result in practical applications ranging from better cellphone antennas to DVDs that could cram 100 movies onto a single disc.
