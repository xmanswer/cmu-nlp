Thunderbird Lodge sits on 140 forested acres that jut into Lake Tahoe. Situated on Tahoe's largely undeveloped eastern shore, the lodge is surrounded by gardens and has views across the water to snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada. The lodge was built in the late 1930s as the summer estate of George Whittell Jr., whose grandfather made a fortune in the California gold rush. Whittell had a fondness for exotic animals, fast vehicles and the company of the demimonde. He was frequently joined at Thunderbird by Bill, his lion, and Mingo, his Indian elephant, and he gave all-night parties with musicians and showgirls brought from a nearby casino in his 55-foot, 2,000-horsepower mahogany boat. The estate was later owned by Jack Dreyfus, founder of the Dreyfus Fund, who built an addition to the main house in 1985 but rarely visited. In 1999, a nonprofit preservation group assumed control. The tour, which takes an hour, includes the garden and its man-made waterfall, and the three-story Arts and Crafts-style main house, with its wood-paneled central hall, massive stone fireplace and extensive decorative ironwork. Also included are the boathouse, which is reached by a 600-foot tunnel carved through granite; a card house reached by the same tunnel; and a gazebo overlooking the lake. There are eight tours each Wednesday and Thursday, beginning at 9 a.m. (the last one starts at 1:30) through Oct. 31, departing via shuttle from Incline Village, five miles away. The cost is $22. Reservations are required and can be made at the visitors bureau: (800) 468-2463. Information: (775) 832-8750, or www.thunderbird lodge.org.
