Attack of the Clones.'' ``Star Wars''' big bang in 1977 helped make the summer movie season what it is today. ``Clones'' zips into theaters May 16, but spinning a head start will be Friday's ``Spider-Man,'' the first film based on Marvel Comics' top superhero. (Naturally, two Spidey sequels already are in the works.) After ``Spider-Man'' and ``Star Wars'' come ``Men in Black 2,'' ``Stuart Little 2,'' ``Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams'' and ``Austin Powers in Goldmember,'' the third film in that line. Strewn among those films will be ones aiming to start fresh franchises, such as ``XXX,'' in which Vin Diesel (``The Fast and the Furious'') creates a bone-crunching new undercover agent. The cartoon series ``Scooby-Doo'' and ``The Powerpuff Girls'' also will leap to the big screen, as will Disney World's theme-park attraction The Country Bears. (In development are films based on the Disney rides Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion.) Coming soon is ``Halloween: Resurrection,'' with Michael Myers back for more mayhem. (Just released are ``Jason X,'' 10th chapter in the ``Friday the 13th'' series, and ``The Scorpion King,'' a prequel to ``The Mummy Returns,'' which was a sequel to ``The Mummy.'') Got it? Good. Then get this: It's not going to end. In an era of mounting production costs, studios depend on sure-sell familiarity and the potential for vast, ongoing ``ancillary'' profits via video, DVD, cable, merchandising and sequels. Not all such films hinge on youth-market razzle-dazzle. This summer also brings ``The Sum of All Fears,'' with Ben Affleck assuming Harrison Ford's ``Patriot Games'' role as Tom Clancy's smart spy guy, Jack Ryan. Here are 10 likely summer hits, whose release dates are subject to change: ``Star Wars: Episode II _ Attack of the Clones,'' May 16. The second entry in Lucas' prequel trilogy is set 10 years after Anakin Skywalker, future mass murderer, yelled ``Yippee!'' as a 9-year-old in ``Episode I.'' Now grown and played by Hayden Christensen, Anakin has been trained as a Jedi by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and starts to fall for Amidala (Natalie Portman), now a Republic senator. The Jedi must fend off assassins while warfare looms. Based on early clips, ``Clones'' promises ample romance and lots of vivid action without the kid-geared foolishness and impenetrable plotting (a ``legal blockade''?) of the previous film. But the title should have been jettisoned into deep space. ``The Bourne Identity,'' June 14. Matt Damon is the amnesiac hero of novelist Robert Ludlum's international thriller who must learn his identity while being hunted in Europe. All he can remember are his special spy skills. ``Lilo &AMP; Stitch,'' June 21. If you liked the contemporary humor of ``The Emperor's New Groove,'' this could be up your alley. A feisty little alien hits Earth and is adopted by a Hawaiian girl in this animated yarn from Disney. Voices are by Tia Carrere, Ving Rhames, Jason Scott Lee and others, with songs by the King of ``Blue Hawaii,'' Elvis Presley. ``Minority Report,'' June 21. Steven Spielberg directs Tom Cruise for the first time in this film noir-styled sci-fi action thriller about a detective who uses psychic tools to halt murderers before they strike. Wouldn't you know? He's accused of a murder-to-come himself. ``Men in Black 2,'' July 3. The boys in black are back, as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith of the 1997 hit return to protect Earth from the scum of the universe. Newcomer Lara Flynn Boyle plays a vile Kylothian monster disguised as a lingerie model. When she takes over the MIB building, Smith must get Jones _ whose memory was erased _ to help him save the day. ``Stuart Little 2,'' July 19. Michael J. Fox again voices the lovable mouse, a computer-animated critter adopted by Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie in 1999's original. They all return as Stuart and snide kitty Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane) become unlikely allies, crossing New York to rescue a bird friend voiced by Melanie Griffith. James Woods voices a wicked falcon, Jonathan Lipnicki again plays Stuart's stepbrother, and Rob Minkoff again directs. ``Austin Powers in Goldmember,'' July 26. New Line unleashes the randy '60s spy for a third goof fest. Here Austin battles Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard and newcomer Goldmember, with Mike Myers playing all four roles. The twist is setting the story in the 1970s. Beyonce Knowles of Destiny's Child plays Austin's new love interest, Foxy Cleopatra. ``Signs,'' Aug. 2. Mel Gibson plays a farmer who finds a message carved into his crops _ perhaps by aliens? _ in this thriller from director-writer M. Night Shyamalan of ``The Sixth Sense.'' Joaquin Phoenix co-stars. ``Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,'' Aug. 7. Austin-based writer-director Robert Rodriguez again shows that you don't need Hollywood to make a colorful, globe-spanning adventure. It's a sequel to his lighthearted 2001 hit about a family of spies. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino again are the parents, with Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara returning as the intrepid kids. This time they land on a mysterious island, home of a scientist (Steve Buscemi) and strange creatures. Two rival spy kids pop up, as do spy grandparents Ricardo Montalban and Holland Taylor. ``Spider-Man,'' Friday. The Marvel Comics icon finally hits the big screen in this film starring Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as love interest Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe as deranged baddie the Green Goblin.
