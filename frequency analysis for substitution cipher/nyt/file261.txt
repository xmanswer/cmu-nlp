Four years ago, John Forte was on top of the world. A producer and rapper known for his work with the Fugees, he was considered one of the brightest stars in their creative entourage and had just signed a solo deal with Columbia Records. Two years ago, Forte fell off: He was dropped by Columbia after poor sales of his solo CD and was trying to find some way to continue his music career. Today, his life couldn't get much worse: He is in federal prison in Texas, serving a 14-year sentence for drug charges after being caught with suitcases of liquid cocaine worth an estimated $1.5 million. (Forte is appealing his conviction.) Despite this progression of events, however, this is not just another story about a downward spiral. Late last month, as Forte sat in jail, the label Transparent Music released his second solo album, ``I, John,'' a beautiful, reflective set of songs more influenced by Bob Marley and Finley Quaye than by mainstream rap. The songs smoothly blend trip-hop, rhythm-and-blues, rap and reggae, resulting in a soulful sound that is breezy on the surface but solid in the foundation. Appropriately, the album begins with Forte's own version of the classic ``What a Difference a Day Makes.'' ``John Forte had the same impact on me as Maxwell had when I first heard him,'' said David Passick, who manages the neo-soul singer Maxwell and signed Forte to Transparent Music, which he runs with Herbie Hancock and others. ``His music was so genuine, so authentic.'' ``I knew he was in a very difficult position, on home arrest and couldn't go anywhere but his mother's house and the studio,'' Passick added, commenting on signing an artist whose ability to promote his album was uncertain. ``What was extraordinary was that everybody knew that they were making a record in a short time not because he was going on a tour, but because no one had any idea what road he was going down and where he'd be.'' In an interview conducted by letter from prison, Forte said the entire album (with the exception of one rap) was written between the time he was arrested and the time he was sentenced. ``My days were filled with emotion,'' he wrote. ``The pending trial was never too far off my thoughts. Recording `I, John' was my therapy. It provided the outlet for me to lift some of the burdens that weighed me down. Although that time period was particularly dark, it was also bright with love. The album acted much like a journal in that it documented my hopes, my dreams, my fantasies and my fears.'' Forte spent his teen-age years caught between two worlds: Brownsville, his neighborhood in Brooklyn, and Phillips Exeter Academy, the exclusive boarding school he attended. After studying music business at New York University, where the rapper Talib Kweli was his roommate, he was hired to work in the artists and repertory department of the rap label Rawkus. There he met Lauryn Hill, who enlisted him for two songs on the Fugees' breakthrough album, ``The Score.'' Her collaborator in the Fugees, Wyclef Jean, also took a liking to Forte and gave him a guest turn on his solo single ``We Trying to Stay Alive.'' Forte then recorded one album with Columbia, ``Poly Sci,'' before being dropped. His trouble began two years ago at a party at the Manhattan club Sway, where he met two women. In July 2000, Forte was arrested at Newark International Airport after one of those women handed him luggage containing about 31 pounds of frozen liquid cocaine. Prosecutors accused him of being part of a network of smugglers hiring people to transport drugs from Mexico and Central America. Lawyers for Forte said he had been ``set up'' and that the charges were untrue. Among his biggest supporters is Carly Simon, who appears on his album. ``He's going to be out,'' she said confidently. ``John is not a drug dealer and doesn't use drugs.'' She interpreted his predicament this way: ``He became involved with some people with whom he would have preferred not to find out too much about what they were doing. With the emphasis on innocently, he took some advice on how to get some money to make his record.'' Forte first met Simon through her son, Ben. ``He's a charismatic kid, who was taught that if you have a germ of it in you, let it grow before you go out in the streets, where it can get messy,'' Carly Simon said of Forte. ``And then he went on to go to Exeter and got some nips and tucks and learned to be more of a whitey than he was expected to be and was accepted, as in the 'hood. And all this made him a very complicated person.'' Forte spent several months with Simon on Martha's Vineyard, where her neighbors Diane Sawyer and Mike Nichols were also impressed by his charm and intelligence. During that time, Forte helped Simon with her songs on her album ``The Bedroom Tapes,'' even teaching her how to rap. In return, she encouraged him to sing. ``I complained to Carly that I didn't have the `chops' for singing,'' Forte wrote. ``I didn't sound like Marvin Gaye. She said, `I know, you sound like John Forte.''' ``She gave me the push I needed to trust my own voice,'' he added. ``My singing voice. Slowly but surely, I realized the benefits of being able to not only rap about an experience, but to be able to sing about it as well. Sometimes you just need to sing.'' Also appearing on the album are the singer Esthero and the trip-hop visionary Tricky, who lends his sinister whisper to ``Trouble Again,'' which is also included on the soundtrack of the television show ``Dark Angel.'' Though much of the album is about Forte's arrest and what he describes as feelings of injustice and betrayal, there is another element, heard in slow-clicking ballads like ``How Could I?'' ``There is a lady in my life that I love,'' Forte wrote. ``She was with me before, during and after my trial and conviction. A great deal of the album is an ode to her very existence.'' ``I've made plenty of mistakes in the past,'' he continued. ``Writing songs to her and about her was progress in healing those wounds. You ask me later on in the interview if I have any regrets, one _ I wish I would have kissed her more. Her name is Elizabeth.''
