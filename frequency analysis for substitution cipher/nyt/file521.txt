Rachel Hollands sat barefoot on a faux leopard skin bench, holding a pink tennis shoe in her left hand. Her eyes browsed other models while she slid her foot into the backless sneaker. She noticed a buzz among the surrounding customers, and leaned over to catch the end of a short but informative conversation. Upon hearing the news, a look of shock grazed her youthful eyes, and she gripped the shoe as if it were the last of its kind. ``I had no idea!'' said Hollands, 23, who had just been informed that the man who made the footwear was now a convicted criminal. The flagship Steve Madden store on West 34th Street in Manhattan was filled with young consumers eager to purchase trendy bowling shoes. Others were spending their earnings from after-school jobs on height-enhancing heels. But none of Steve Madden's customers was aware of his recent conviction or sentencing for securities fraud and money laundering, nor did anyone seem to care. ``Will it stop me from buying his shoes? No.'' said Lyndi Bartolomeo, 25, an accounting recruiter in Manhattan. ``But do I think he's a scumbag? Yes.'' Bartolomeo frankly described her generation as selfish, having little interest in politics, morals or values. She wagered that few people under 25 would understand the complicated charges against the 45-year-old designer, who is on his way to a federal prison in Florida for three years and mandatory participation in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. Madden would probably be happy with the response echoed throughout the store: ``If the shoe fits, buy it.'' Asia Darakjian, the 24-year-old manager felt that Madden's imprisonment would have little effect on the store's sales. ``There are so many other people holding the reins,'' she said of the company. ``It's business as usual.'' That was certainly true for customer Hollands. ``At the end of the day, all we care about is fashion,'' Hollands said. ``It all goes back to consumer behavior. People are going to buy the shoes if they like them, no matter whose name is attached to them.'' Teen-agers do not seem to care about Madden's indiscretions, and neither do Wall Street investors. ``The stock is at its all-time high, and we are predicted $25 a share by this summer,'' said Fred Sears, a fund manager who specializes in youth retail at Investors Capital in Boston. ``The Gen X market is unlimited. These kids are smart, not dumb. They know what they like and they are buying.'' Sears monitors similar brands, like the clothing maker Quicksilver, which are soaring on Wall Street. Sears said that investors and analysts give too much weight to adult responses, considering the consumers are under 30. ``Money doesn't know any morality,'' said Sears. ``Madden has great style. He has changed fashion. Sure he's corrupt and greedy, but he is being punished for that.'' Madden's role in the company has been dramatically reduced to comply with U.S. laws that prohibit him from being an officer of any company for the next seven years. According to a new contract signed last year with Steve Madden Ltd., his title has changed from chief executive officer to creative design chief. The new title has cut his total annual earning in half, from an estimated $1.4 million to $700,000 a year. The company now owns exclusive rights to his brand name. A spokesman for the company said that it has put in place a ``strong management team'' and a ``talented group of designers'' and is ``well positioned to continue its success.'' The New York-based shoe company, with revenues of $243 million last year, made little comment on Madden's sentencing to 41 months in jail and an $8.2 million fine for restitution and forfeiture. ``We have been preparing for this moment for a long time,'' the company stated in a press release that it handed out at the sentencing. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with him.'' April's shoe of the month is a bowling style, which according to Darakjian has been selling out for both sexes. Although the shoes are marketed to a young audience, the scandal has attracted attention from an older crowd. ``I was intrigued by the news and wanted to take a look,'' said an older woman in the store, who would only identify herself only as ``curious.'' Standing by a sales rack of cowboy boots and turquoise pumps, she said, ``I have never been in the store before, but I wanted to see what the craze was all about.'' Marshall Mintz, 29, a criminal defense lawyer and satisfied customer who recently purchased the two-tone bowling shoe in brown, was quick to defend Madden. ``He's serving time for what he did wrong and repaying his debt to society,'' said Mintz, who read about the indictment in an April issue of The Law Journal. ``It's a fad. Right now he's huge but in three years he may be coming back to nothing.'' Mintz predicts that, in the near future, everyone will be walking around prison in bowling shoes. ``I can already picture the jailhouse sneaker,'' he joked. ``Available in black &AMP; white stripes.''
