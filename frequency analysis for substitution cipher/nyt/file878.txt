San Fernando Valley residents and others joined in a National Day of Prayer on Thursday with a Christian service in Porter Ranch, an interfaith service in Encino and a secular event at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. At times sounding like an evangelical preacher, former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North brought an audience of more than 800 to its feet at a National Day of Prayer breakfast in the Reagan Library courtyard. North, a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, spoke for an hour on God and world affairs at the church-organized event held in the library of the president under whom he served. ``We owe it to our children, our grandchildren and our country to get down on our knees and praise God for his blessings,'' said North, who hosts ``War Stories'' on Fox News Channel. ``This is a nation that deserves to be prayed for.'' The event was one of numerous local observances of the National Day of Prayer, which was officially established in 1952 and later designated by Reagan to be held on the first Thursday in May. Those representing Buddhists, Muslims, Catholics, Protestants and Jews stood side by side at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino for the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council's morning service. Each representative explained what prayer means in his religion's tradition to the group of about 100, and afterward the synagogue opened for a tour, said the temple's senior rabbi, Harold Schulweis. ``What people enjoyed was that their religious leaders were standing side by side and praying side by side. It was that itself, and that camaraderie, that spoke louder than anything being said,'' Schulweis said. ``Given the atmosphere today in the world, this kind of meeting becomes even more important than ever,'' Schulweis said. ``When you meet as we did, you see the humanity behind the theology.'' At Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch, an estimated 400 people gathered to pray for family, the military, the nation and Israel. ``We prayed that people of our world would thirst for the Lord and that the Lord would quench that thirst,'' said the Rev. Dudley Rutherford, pastor of the church. ``This is a yearly reminder that we as a nation need to turn to God, pray for the president, Congress and the military. ``On Sept. 11, in the immediate days afterward, people went to church en masse,'' he said. ``In the last six to seven months, this has waned. ``People that hungered and thirst in the few days after were looking for God, but they are not doing that now,'' he said. ``They've gone back to their old ways, and we would hope the day would come when there will be no need for a National Day of Prayer but praying every day.'' In Simi Valley, North also spoke of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, when he was aboard a Northwest Airlines flight heading to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., when a hijacked American Airlines plane slammed into the Pentagon. Looking down from his plane, North witnessed what he thought looked like a nuclear attack. North said he still carries his boarding pass in his briefcase. North also recounted how prayer kept him going when he was forced to testify before a congressional committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair, a secret dealing to fund the Nicaraguan contra rebels from profits gained by selling arms to Iran. Michael Reagan, the former president's eldest son, also was in the audience and said a few words before North spoke. ``It is a wonderful day,'' said Michael Reagan, who hosts a conservative radio talk show. ``It is a special day. It is a day I think of my father. ``God is with him. God is with the family. God is with this great nation.'' Simi Valley resident Patricia Eddy later praised North's speech. ``I thought it was wonderful, magnificent,'' she said. ``It was one of the best speeches I've heard in a long time. It was uplifting.'' Eddy, who is in her 70s, said the message she received from North's speech was to ``trust in the Lord'' and ``pray for our leaders.'' Not everyone in attendance was a North fan, but Elizabeth and Gilbert Hernandez changed their minds about the decorated Marine after hearing him speak. ``I was not an Ollie North fan. I remembered the scandal,'' said Gilbert Hernandez, 46. ``To hear this person say he prays, gets on his knees and asks God for help, puts him in the realm of, he is like the guy next door.'' His wife agreed, saying she now intends to buy North's book and watch his TV show. ``I didn't expect he would speak so well,'' the 43-year-old said. ``It was fantastic. He had me laughing one minute and in tears in another minute.''  XXX
