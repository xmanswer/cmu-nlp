Thirty years after he developed ``MASH'' for television, and 19 years after he last cracked a prime-time schedule (with ``AfterMASH''), Gelbart hopes to be back this fall with a family drama for ABC. His reputation helped draw an impressive cast for the pilot episode, including Martin Landau, John Larroquette, Robert Sean Leonard, Mary McDonnell, Mimi Rogers and Patrick Dempsey. If ABC picks up the series _ a decision that won't be announced until later this month _ Gelbart will become one of the oldest people writing and producing in prime time. But he doesn't think that that would change anyone's hiring practices. ``Show business is about the new,'' he said in an interview at his home here. ``The new season, the new movie, the new stars.'' Tentatively titled ``The Corsairs,'' the pilot involves a media mogul (played by Larroquette) and the rivalries in his family. It may sound like a prime-time soap of the ``Dallas'' or ``Dynasty'' vintage, but, Gelbart said, it was not. ``We're talking about a world that affects us a great deal more than what's happening at the country club,'' he said. ``We're talking about what's happening to our minds and to our culture.'' ``The Corsairs'' would revisit themes that were central to two movies Gelbart wrote for HBO in the 1990s: ``Weapons of Mass Distraction,'' which starred Gabriel Byrne and Ben Kingsley as battling media barons, and ``Barbarians at the Gate,'' his Emmy-winning adaptation of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's book about the RJR Nabisco takeover fight. The rich and powerful have always been a target for Gelbart's satire. But he suggests that time may have caught up with him. ``You can't really satirize anything anymore, because the daily headlines themselves are satirical,'' he said. Pointing to the Enron scandal, he added: ``It's already a satire on honesty, civility, integrity and honor. So you would have to go further and have these guys accused of eating people. Literally, eating people.'' Gelbart has exercised his satiric gift in a variety of mediums over the last six decades. He began his career in show business at 16, writing for Danny Thomas, Sid Caesar, Bob Hope and Danny Kaye. With Burt Shevelove, he wrote the book for the Stephen Sondheim musical ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and won a 1963 Tony Award. His screenwriting credits include ``Oh, God!'' (1977) and ``Tootsie'' (1982). In 1990 he won another Tony, for the book of ``City of Angels.'' He remains best known for ``MASH,'' however. Based on Robert Altman's 1970 film about an Army hospital in the Korean War, it was one of the highest-rated shows on television for most of its 11-year run (1972-83). ``Usually, comedy shows only influence other comedy shows,'' said Alan Alda, who played Hawkeye Pierce, the wisecracking surgeon at the show's center. `` `MASH' is one of the few comedies that influenced dramatic shows as well.'' Aaron Sorkin, the creator of ``The West Wing,'' said that the authenticity in ``MASH's'' depiction of life near the front still affects television writers. ``You believed that the blood was real on `MASH,''' he said. ``The notion that a story needs to be told from some place of truth and reality is where `The West Wing' owes its greatest debt to Larry Gelbart.'' Years before single-camera comedies like ``Malcolm in the Middle'' became popular, ``MASH'' pioneered the format (although CBS insisted that the program carry a laugh track). The combination of comedy and drama that Gelbart pioneered on ``MASH'' is now the hallmark of successful producers like Sorkin and and David E. Kelley (``Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice''). While his greatest success on television came in comedy, Gelbart said, drama offers him more flexibility now, if only because of time. Each ``MASH'' episode was 26 minutes 20 seconds long; today's comedies run 22 minutes. ``I wouldn't even know how to write a half-hour show anymore,'' he said. And sacrificing those four minutes to commercials, he said, bodes poorly for the future. ``If they can do it in 22 minutes,'' he said, ``then they can do it in 18.'' Gelbart's post-``MASH'' comedies didn't set a good example, anyway. In 1980 he created ``United States,'' an innovative series about marriage starring Beau Bridges and Helen Shaver. NBC canceled it after seven episodes. In 1983 he returned to CBS with ``AfterMASH,'' a sequel that lasted a season and a half. Then there's the one that got away: ``Three's Company'' Gelbart said that after he left ``MASH'' in 1976, Michael Eisner, then president of ABC Television, asked him to adapt the British television comedy ``Man About the House'' for American viewers. Initially Gelbart accepted, and he was instrumental in the casting of John Ritter as a single man renting an apartment with two single women. Then, he says, he had a change of heart, turning his back on what might have been the most lucrative deal of his career. ``It had to be $50 million, $60 million,'' he said wistfully. ``But to go from triage to menage a trois, I just couldn't do it.'' More recently, Gelbart said, his absence from the airwaves has been because of his own creative missteps. He wrote a script for a series about plastic surgeons, but neither he nor HBO was happy with it. Last season he tried a family drama for ABC about a grandfather. The network passed, a decision that didn't surprise him. In an industry obsessed with attracting viewers age 18 to 49 _ the ``holy demographic,'' he calls them _ what took him aback was ABC's interest in the project in the first place. But Gelbart does not see himself as a victim of network ageism. He counts himself among the lucky few. At least he can get into the executive suites. Most of his peers, he said, can't even get their calls returned. ``It's downright mean,'' he said. ``There's no age on the page. The words are either pertinent or they're not. The sender has nothing to do with it.'' Stephen McPherson, president of Disney's Touchstone Television, which is producing ``The Corsairs,'' agreed. ``We're making a mistake as an industry to think that what's around the corner is better than what we have,'' he said. ``The people who have been through it and have done it successfully have a lot more to say.'' Given its cast and its timely subject matter, ``The Corsairs'' may be Gelbart's best shot yet at another prime-time series. It may also be one of his last. ``It's like having a baby very late in life,'' he said of the project. Should the network pick up the series, he would assume more of a grandfatherly role. Because of the often grueling time commitment that series production demands, Gelbart already has plans to delegate the day-to-day producing responsibilities. ``I can come in when I like, I can go out when I like, and they do all the heavy lifting,'' he said. That would also allow him to continue work on several other projects, including a movie for HBO on the life of the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa and a musical with his ``City of Angels'' collaborators Cy Coleman and David Zippel. He has also been in talks with the Manhattan Theater Club about staging his adaptation of ``Lysistrata,'' Aristophanes' ribald comedy. (This after the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., run by his friend Robert Brustein, rejected the script last month, finding it overly weighted with sexual references, a decision that touched off a public spat.) So what's behind this burst of creativity, when most men his age are content to relax on the golf course? It may simply be a hedge against mortality. ``The writing has always been on the wall, but the wall is a lot closer these days,'' Gelbart said. ``The wall is on rollers.''
