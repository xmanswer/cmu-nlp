The University of Texas' dispute with Xerox over illegal use of UT-licensed software is over, with Xerox promising to pay past and future fees. The agreement, to be finalized this month, produced a confidential financial settlement and resolved three years of controversy about Xerox's unauthorized use of the ACITS remote-printing software. In a federal copyright infringement suit filed in February, UT claimed that Xerox owed the university as much as $4 million in licensing fees for duplicating and distributing the software to its customers. ``Individuals chose to download the software. It was not a corporate policy, and the company did not condone this action,'' Xerox spokesman Bill McKee said Wednesday. ``As part of the settlement, we will create a dedicated Web site available to Xerox product users and technicians to make the software available on a licensed arrangement.'' Juan Sanchez, UT vice president for research, said the university had to file the lawsuit to get the company's attention. ``Every time we see a violation of copyright laws, we should act on it and not look the other way,'' he said.
