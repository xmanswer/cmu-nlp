``What makes the Cannes Film Festival unique,'' said Jean-Michel Frodon, the chief film critic of the French daily Le Monde, ``is that it places all of the cinema on the same level.'' Indeed, for 12 days each May in this Victorian-era resort town on the Cote d'Azur, the most profit-oriented Hollywood producers rub shoulders with the most idealistic filmmakers from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere _ often literally, as they squeeze their way past one another down the Croisette, the beachfront promenade that is Cannes' Main Street. This year's event, which opens on May 15 with Woody Allen's ``Hollywood Ending'' and ends with Claude Lelouche's ``And Now ... Ladies and Gentlemen,'' looks to be as eclectic as usual. The festival's Official Competition _ the most prestigious of Cannes' many different sections, and the category in which films compete for the festival's coveted and commercially potent grand prize, the Palme d'Or _ includes 21 films from 15 countries, chosen from 939 features screened by the selection committee. On paper, it looks like one of the strongest lineups in years, a deft balance of regions, styles and sensibilities. Amos Gitai, the maverick Israeli filmmaker best known for ``Kaddosh,'' his harsh look at Israeli's ultra-orthodox society, will be back with a new feature, ``Kedma.'' Elia Suleiman, the Palestinian filmmaker whose ``Chronicle of a Disappearance'' won the best first-feature prize at the 1996 Venice International Film Festival, will be in competition with ``Intervention Divine.'' Films from Algeria, Turkey, Lebanon and Syria will be presented in the festival's ``Un Certain Regard'' section, which is reserved for work by newer filmmakers. Suleiman will be making his first appearance on the Croisette. So will the Chinese filmmaker Zhang Ke Jia, the creator of the brilliant social epic ``Platform'' in 2000. His new film, ``Unknown Pleasures,'' was shot clandestinely in China last year. Many of the American directors in competition are Cannes debutants. Alexander Payne (``Election'') is offering ``About Schmidt,'' a comedy with Jack Nicholson and Hope Davis. Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook are presenting the animated feature ``Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.'' Paul Thomas Anderson, the Los Angeles-based independent (``Boogie Nights'' and ``Magnolia'') will make his first trip to Cannes with one of the most anticipated films of the program, ``Punch-Drunk Love,'' a romantic comedy starring the unlikely couple of Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. Michael Moore (``Roger and Me'') will make his competition debut with ``Bowling for Columbine,'' about America's obsession with guns, the first documentary to compete for a Palme d'Or since Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle's ``Silent World'' won the top prize in 1955. But the festival remains loyal to its established stars. Canada's David Cronenberg returns with ``Spider,'' starring Gabriel Byrne as an acute schizophrenic. Italy's Marco Bellochio (``China Is Near'') will offer ``The Hour of Religion,'' a story of a Roman Catholic education. The Dardenne brothers, Luc and Jean-Pierre, Palme winners for ``Rosetta'' in 1999, are back with ``The Son.'' Roman Polanski, a festival regular since ``The Tenant'' in 1976, returns with the Holocaust tale ``The Pianist,'' with Adrien Brody as a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto. Mike Leigh, whose ``Secrets and Lies'' won the Palme d'Or in 1996, will be back with ``All or Nothing,'' which he cryptically described by telephone from his London office as ``a contemporary film, about emotions, about love, about pain, and that's about all I'm going to tell you.'' This will be Leigh's third time in competition in Cannes. (His ``Naked'' won awards in 1993 for direction and David Thewlis' starring role.) He remains a staunch supporter of the festival. ``It's a great focus on world cinema, and it is also deliciously and gloriously liberated from Hollywood,'' he said. ``It allows us Europeans to get on with it, without any pressure from your side of the water.'' Leigh will be joined in competition by the fellow countrymen _ and fellow festival regulars _ Ken Loach (with ``Sweet Sixteen'') and Michael Winterbottom (with ``24-Hour Party People''). Then there are the filmmakers whose inclusion in the Cannes lineup seems almost mandatory. This year's vieux routiers (usual suspects) include Finland's Aki Kaurismaki (``The Man Without a Past''), Russia's Aleksandr Sokurov (``Russian Ark''), Iran's Abbas Kiarostami (the video feature ``Ten'') and Portugual's Manoel De Oliveira (``The Uncertainty Principle'') _ all filmmakers with pronounced styles and dedicated followings. On the traditional side of psychological realism and naturalistic storytelling, there are Nicole Garcia's ``Adversaire'' and Robert Guediguian's ``Marie-Jo and Her Two Loves.'' The more radical fringe is represented by Olivier Assayas (``Irma Vep''), whose ``Demonlover'' features Connie Nielsen, Chloe Sevigny, Gina Gershon and lots of digital effects; and ``Irreversible,'' a drama starring Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel from Gaspar Noe, the director of the grisly, nihilistic ``I Stand Alone.'' ``It is not that Cannes is the enemy of Hollywood or the MPAA,'' said Frodon, referring to the Motion Picture Association of America, the lobbying group formed by the major studios that has long sought to strike down the tariffs and quotas that France has imposed against foreign producers. ``Those films have their place here as well. It is just that Cannes places them on an equal standing with other films from other countries.'' The festival receives the kind of coverage in Europe's newspapers and on television that major sports playoffs get in the United States. The critical handicappers can't afford to neglect the ``smaller'' films. Cannes' famously unpredictable jury is as likely to reward an unknown director from Yugoslavia (as happened in 1985, with Emir Kusturica's ``When Father Was Away on Business'') as it is Francis Ford Coppola's ``Apocalypse Now'' (which won in 1979). This year's nine-member jury, led by the director David Lynch and including the actresses Sharon Stone and Michelle Yeoh, promises to be as free-spirited as always. ``The first time I went to Cannes, in 1993 with `Naked,' I innocently bought into some of the nonsense that some people talk about,'' Leigh remembered. ``For example, there's a great deal of mythology about how the jury is under pressure from the director of the festival. But when I was on the jury in 1997, I found that it couldn't be less true. The jury is entirely independent _ probably the most unimpeached and unimpeachable institution in the world.'' A prize in Cannes is not a guarantee of commercial success, Frodon said, but it does mean a great deal at the European box office _ certainly more than any other European award. Filmmakers like Hou Hsiao-hsien in Taiwan or Kiarostami in Iran can lead truly international careers, independent of their films' reception at home, thanks to the stature conferred upon them by the festival and the financing such stature brings. For the French, Cannes remains a sign of the national commitment to the preservation and promotion of an alternative cinema, which gets funds from both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Cinema Center. Canal Plus, the French pay-television network, also underwrites a number of foreign productions, including ``Mulholland Drive,'' which won a best-director prize for Lynch last year. There's all that, and the South of France, too. ``The other thing about Cannes,'' Leigh said, ``apart from anything else, is that you do cop for some extremely good dinners.''
