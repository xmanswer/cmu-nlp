``Umm, it has a good beat and you can dance to it.'' That famous verdict by bobby soxers appearing on ``American Bandstand,'' the first network TV show dedicated exclusively to rock 'n' roll, is still the final word on new pop product some 50 years after the phrase was first stammered between sharp snaps of Bazooka bubble gum. ``American Bandstand's'' iconic ``Rate-A-Record'' segment, where teens would listen and then appraise a new single, was just one of many farsighted features of the now-defunct Saturday-afternoon series that lives on in museums, music archives and the fond memories of those who appeared on the ABC TV show or grew up in its good-natured glow. Hosted by perennial nice guy Dick Clark from 1956 to 1987, which was most of its broadcast life, ``Bandstand'' was the forerunner of the multiple cable networks now devoted to various kinds of pop music programming. By featuring artists lip-syncing their latest songs, it gave much of the national audience its first glimpse of some of the biggest music stars of four decades. ``It was MTV before MTV, VH1 before VH1, 'Soul Train' before 'Soul Train,' '' said rock 'n' roll pioneer Little Richard, who first made a splash on ``Bandstand'' in the late '50s. ``It put you in the public eye immediately, and you'd see the results in record sales just as quick.'' Leif Garrett, a teen heartthrob of the '70s, agrees: ``It could make or break your career. If you appeared on the show, you'd be catapulted into the stratosphere. If you didn't appear on the show, you could just as easily fall out of the sky.'' WE'RE GOING HOPPIN' Richard and Garrett join Michael Jackson, Cher, Alanis Morissette, Brandy, Stevie Wonder, Babyface and KC &AMP; the Sunshine Band on ``American Bandstand's 50th ... A Celebration!'' two-hour special broadcast at 8 p.m. Friday on ABC. The prime-time gala mixes segments from an anniversary concert shot last month with archival clips cherry-picked from more than 10,000 musical appearances in 6,000-plus hours of airtime. ``The taping with all those stars was the most incredible experience I've had in a while,'' said Janice Marie Johnson of A Taste of Honey, whose 1978 smash ``Boogie Oogie Oogie'' is frequently sampled by hip-hop artists. ``I was like a kid in a candy store. I was truly honored to be part of it.'' Of the historic material, taped performances by Blondie, Chubby Checker, Jan &AMP; Dean, Jefferson Airplane, Aretha Franklin, Madonna, the Mamas &AMP; the Papas, Diana Ross, ABBA, the Doors and Celine Dion were among those making the final cut. ``It was tough boiling it down to the most memorable performances,'' Clark, 72, said from the Burbank headquarters where he oversees a music, TV and movie empire worth around $300 million. ``We probably missed some artists we would like to have used. Hopefully, there will one day be an entire cable channel playing performance footage divided into decades.'' But in a nation of short attention spans, as well as a music scene divided into arcane genres, Friday's look back won't be chronological. ``There are so many different kinds of pop music now,'' Clark said. ``In the old days, you could put Fats Domino and Percy Faith back to back. Today, it's more segregated and much more complex.'' WHERE THINGS ARE POPPIN' It all must have seemed pretty darn simple in 1952 when ``American Bandstand'' started life as a regional show in Philadelphia under the name ``Bandstand.'' Original host Bob Horn stood on a cramped set that resembled a record store and screened clips of musicians as a teen-age audience danced to the latest tunes. In 1956, 27-year-old local DJ Dick Clark was recruited as host after a scandal cost Horn the job. The following year, the televised sock hop was picked up by 67 ABC affiliates, some for the full 90 minutes and others for an hour or less. ``Bandstand'' initially aired weekdays after school but soon landed a prime-time slot. Clark dropped the record store concept, using a simple set of bleachers and a podium that now resides in the Smithsonian. ``Dancing was a major, major feature,'' said chart analyst Rob Durkee, author of ``American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century,'' who plans to watch the Clark special. ``The kids who showed up knew all the popular steps -- the Slop, the Hand Jive, the Bop, the Twist. They even invented some -- the Stroll, the Circle, the Chalypso.'' Out in TV Land, kids practiced the new steps in front of the mirror and bought 45s by the singers they saw on the show, making teen stars of Bill Haley &AMP; the Comets, Buddy Holly, Connie Francis, Frankie Avalon, Chubby Checker, Bobby Darin, Fabian and Ritchie Valens, kick-starting the record industry. ``It was so simple,'' Clark marveled. ``We played records, and they danced. The thing was a hit within three days. There was no audience testing back then. It happened by itself.'' On the show, Clark introduced guests who lip-synced to their own songs. Then, a few teens were chosen from the audience for ``Rate-A-Record.'' In 1963, shortly before the series moved to Hollywood to become a Saturday-afternoon fixture, ``Bandstand's'' jukebox jury gave ``She Loves You'' the thumbs-down and had a good giggle at the Fab Four's mop-top haircuts and matching outfits. WE'RE GONNA DROP IN The Beatles -- as well as Elvis Presley and Ricky Nelson -- never appeared on ``American Bandstand.'' But it wasn't because of the vote of no-confidence from the peanut gallery. Clark says the roughly $150 the program paid to guests wasn't much to write home about, even in those days. Other regular features included a weekly Top 10 and an annual dance contest. In fact, ``Bandstand's'' dancers were said to receive more fan mail than many Hollywood stars -- 45,000 letters a week at times. ``It was an open window on a world we were all interested in,'' Clark said. ``And it was one of the first reality shows -- these dancers were ordinary kids. They weren't trained dancers; they were real people off the street dancing to records.'' After a 30-year run in which ``American Bandstand'' accurately reflected the changing musical times -- rock 'n' roll, British Invasion, acid-rock, metal, folk-rock, disco, punk, new wave and the first stirrings of hip-hop -- Clark and ABC parted ways in 1987 when the network wanted the show cut to 30 minutes. Wanting to keep the hourlong format instead, Clark moved ``American Bandstand'' to syndication and then took the show to the USA cable network where David Hirsch became host until the series fizzled out entirely in 1989. ``My dream is to get it back on the air,'' Clark says. ``I'd love to do a contemporary version.'' A favorite memory of network's coolest music series involved Madonna's TV debut in 1984. The gum-snapping Material Mom-to-be lip-synched her first hit, ``Holiday,'' and then stood with Clark for the interview. ``What is your New Year's resolution, not for 1984, but for the rest of your life?'' Clark asked. ``To rule the world,'' she snapped -- and it seemed likely. ``American Bandstand'' was hip, you could dance to it, and every Saturday it proved rock 'n' roll was truly here to stay. --- AMERICAN BANDSTAND'S 50TH ...
