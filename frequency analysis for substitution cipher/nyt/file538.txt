TV's longest-running program -- NBC's ``Meet the Press'' -- makes ``Bonanza'' and ``Gunsmoke'' look like flashes in the pan. ``Meet the Press'' was just the beginning of network's commitment to news programming. -``Meet the Press'': Launched on the Mutual Radio Network and picked up for television in 1947 with radio producer Martha Rountree as moderator and feisty reporter Lawrence E. Spivak as lead panelist, the show quickly became a topic of discussion among Washington insiders. Soon, power players were angling to be interviewed, using ``Meet the Press'' to make big statements or fierce accusations against rival politicians and bureaucrats. For 55 years, guests have made good use of the national platform -- and often been knocked off balance on it by no-holds-barred questions. -Nightly news: In 1948, soon after CBS launched its nightly ``Television News With Douglas Edwards,'' NBC got into the evening news game with ``Camel Newsreel Theater,'' a 10-minute roundup of headlines presented by John Cameron Swayze. The network had reservations about the cigarette sponsorship of the show, which grew to 15 minutes and was renamed ``Camel News Caravan.'' For instance, Camel insisted that no newsmakers be shown smoking cigars (excepting only Winston Churchill) and made sure the newscast always ended with a shot of Swayze's burning cigarette in an ashtray. Chet Huntley and David Brinkley first teamed up to cover the 1956 national political conventions. That October they were paired for the evening news, impressing viewers with a give and take that spanned the miles between them; Huntley was in New York and Brinkley in Washington. The sign-off of ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' -- ``Good night, Chet'' ``Good night, David'' -- became a pop-culture phrase. Among the personalities NBC has groomed for news stardom is Tom Brokaw, who was just 26 when he became lead anchor at network-owned KNBC in Burbank. NBC tapped him for the White House beat in 1973, the height of the Watergate scandal. Brokaw moved to ``Today'' in 1976 to share co-hosting duties with 25-year-old network novice Jane Pauley, then in 1982 joined Roger Mudd on the ``NBC Nightly News.'' -``Today'': In 1952, the network blazed the trail for morning news programming with ``Today,'' plunking Dave Garroway in front of a live camera in a bare-bones studio. He pointed out the morning's top stories -- literally -- in his ``Today in Two Minutes'' news capsules, by standing in front of a bulletin board plastered with 8-by-10 photos and a newspaper front page. ``Today Girl'' Estelle Parsons chalked major metropolitan weather reports on a blackboard. Pat Weaver, then NBC president, boosted the show's ratings by adding a chimpanzee sidekick, J. Fred Muggs. The thinking -- and the reality -- was that kids wanted to watch the chimp, which in turn drew parents to watch the news and interviews. ``Today'' has come a long way since then, making news itself with new sets, live reports from around the globe, and host arrivals and departures, or in the case of Katie Couric, hefty contract renewals. Despite competition from ABC, CBS, CNN and Fox News, ``Today'' averages 6 million viewers a day. -Other news programs: The network that birthed morning information programming and Sunday newsmaker panels was a latecomer to prime-time newsmagazines, trying and failing 17 times before hitting its stride in 1992 with ``Dateline,'' co-anchored by Pauley and Stone Phillips. A few months later, the show made headlines of its own with the controversial ``Waiting to Explode'' story about gas tanks on General Motors pickup trucks. The report showed footage of trucks exploding on impact but failed to mention that ``sparkers'' on the chassis had maximized the explosions. After an on-air mea culpa, ``Dateline'' repaired its tarnished image and went on to ratings success with up to five installments a week.
