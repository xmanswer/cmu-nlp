SUMMER-MOVIES, SUMMER-TEXAS, WRAPSTYLE Updates _ VIETNAM Deletes _ GA-FORSYTH INTERNATIONAL CHINA-ARCHAEOLOGY _ ANYANG, China _ The earliest evidence of Chinese writing and currency were found here, the seat of the Shang Dynasty's capital more than three 3,300 years ago. Archaeologists have been excavating the site for more than 70 years, and still, discoveries keep popping up - intricate bronzes, ancient walled cities, human sacrificial pits. China is a treasure trove of archaeological wonders, some of which can provide valuable information on early humans. Yet rampant construction, massive infrastructure projects and lack of resources are a constant threat to protection of its relics. (Chao, Cox News Service) W/PHOTOS. EUROPE-TILTRIGHT _ LONDON _ French voters go to the polls today in a Europe increasingly tilting to the right. Jean-Marie Le Pen's success in France, the Freedom Party in Austria, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and regional gains in Germany are recent examples of right-wing gains across the continent. What is driving the phenomenon, and will it last? (Melvin, Cox News Service) NATIONAL LICENSES _ NEW YORK _ Legislation just introduced in Congress would require states to develop standardized driver's licenses that would include at least two ``biometric identifiers,'' such as fingerprints and iris scans. The licenses would make it easier for police to check the identity of the holder, but they could also help companies build a database of personal information. A doorman at one Boston bar, for example, swipes licenses through a machine that pulls personal details from a data strip on the back of the license. All this has privacy advocates up in arms. (Emlng, Cox News Service) Moved in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories. COOTER _ SPERRYVILLE, Va. _ Spring has come to this Appalachian hollow and the tourists are back at ``Cooter's'' -- the store and museum where Ben Jones has parked the ``General Lee'' and assembled other stuff from the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' TV show. Jones played Cooter, the friendly mechanic, on the show and also represented an Atlanta suburb in Congress for a couple of terms. Now he apparently has another political itch and is considering a campaign to represent his Virginia district on Capitol Hill. His opponent will be Eric Cantor, a freshman Republican from Richmond. (Dart, Cox News Service) NUKEWASTE _ ROCKY FLATS, Colo. _ Controversy surrounds the disposal of plutonium left over from the nuclear weapon era. The congressman whose district includes the former nuclear weapons factory at Rocky Flats, Rep. Mark Udall, has asked state officials to fine the U.S. Department of Energy if it misses deadlines for cleaning up the site. The $7 billion cleanup of plutonium is scheduled to be complete by 2006, but the governor of South Carolina, where the plutonium is supposed to be sent, is threatening to block the shipments. (Seabrook, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) OPED/EDITORIAL BORDERS-COLUMN _ I'm thinking seriously about becoming an ex-landlord. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) MOVES FRIDAY. BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ Wall Street analysts are supposed to be savvy people who know the industry they cover as well as they know their way home at night. That's why investors pay a lot of money for their advice. Unfortunately, too many of those analysts have behaved as high-paid carnival barkers, trying to lure suckers inside the tent where they would soon be parted with their money. (Jay Bookman is the deputy editorial page editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED WEDNESDAY.. BUSINESS AOLTW-CABLE _ NEW YORK _ AOL Time Warner sees high-speed Internet service as a lifeline, but it faces major hurdles trying to build a subscriber base beyond cable systems it already owns. For one thing, the already busy pace of broadband signups among cable operators suggests that they are in no hurry to market AOL-branded high-speed access. And since the FCC voted last month to classify cable modems as an information, not a cable, service, companies such as Cox and Comcast don't have to provide ``open access'' to AOL Time Warner. What options does that leave the company? (Emling, Cox News Service) Moving Thursday.

(Emlng, Cox News Service) Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories. SKYSCRAPERS _ ATLANTA _ Sept. 11 raised immediate questions about the future of skyscrapers in a terrorist era. But renowned architect Phillip Johnson observed in 1995 that ``the skyscraper is finished.'' By then, the center of development for skyscrapers _ buildings 1,000 feet or taller _ was already shifting to the Far East. More accurately, perhaps, Johnson should have said the skyscraper probably has a limited future in the United States. Skyscrapers have their advocates despite the trauma of Sept. 11, even in New York _ perhaps especially in New York, which has more of them than any other city. (Walker, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ONLINE-BILLS _ ATLANTA _ Online bill paying is the fastest growing payment method, topping debit card growth, according to a Boston consulting firm. (McNaughton, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) LIFESTYLE CANCER-BOOK _ ATLANTA _ Eight years ago, the lives of an art therapist, a photographer and 25 youth with cancer intersected. The art therapist and photographer paired the children's artwork with their photos. The images, and the words the youth wrote to explain them, were haunting and wise. They belonged in a book, everyone agreed. Four months ago, Howard approached the American Cancer Society. They agreed to publish the book, Angels &AMP; Monsters, in August.

This place operates the Florida Space Camp. We also discovered a great fossils store nearby &AMP; a spot to look up close at meandering wild manatees. There are many family motels on the beach &AMP; the region is great for kids. (Godown, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH SUMMER-HORSES _ New exhibit at Tennessee Aquarium ``Seahorses: Beyond Imagination,'' opening May 1.
