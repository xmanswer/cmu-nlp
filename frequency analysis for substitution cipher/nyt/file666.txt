The government already makes all the money. Now it's selling it at a premium. Star-studded money was going for almost six times its face value Thursday at the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. That was where the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing unveiled and set up shop for the ``Lone Star Note,'' a $1 bill with a star at the end of the serial number. Each $1 bill went for $5.95, plus tax. Collectors are expected to buy 120,000 by 2003, said Antoinette Banks, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Reading from a prepared statement, Banks said it is ``a unique $1 star note, made in Texas, by Texans, for Texans or for those who wish they were Texans.'' The notes are printed at the Treasury's Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth. Banks said profits from the sales will help pay for educational programs and a public tour facility that is scheduled to open at the Fort Worth printing plant in 2003. Banks said the Lone Star Note is not just for collectors. ``It is a unique currency-related product,'' she said. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has a whole line of unique currency-related products. They include ``Lucky Bills,'' paper currency guaranteed to have at least three consecutive sevens in each serial number. Each dollar costs $5.95. The ``Prosperity Note'' features serial numbers with 168 or 8888 at the beginning of the serial number. These numbers are supposed to be significant in Chinese symbolism. They also are $5.95. Among the more popular ``currency-related products'' are sheets of uncut bills. A sheet of 16 $1 bills costs $31. You pay $50 for a sheet of 32 $1 bills. A sheet of 16 $10 bills costs $249. The best deal is a five-pound bag of shredded genuine U.S. currency. Each bag contains at least $10,000 worth of shredded money. Each bag costs only $45 in unshredded money. All unique currency-related products can be bought online at www.moneyfactory.com or by calling (800) 456-3408. They also will be available at the Texas Numismatic Association show, scheduled May 10-12 at Fort Worth Amon G. Carter Exhibits Hall. Banks said the Lone Star Notes will be on sale at the show for $4.95 (unshredded). Admission to the show will be $3 (also unshredded.)
