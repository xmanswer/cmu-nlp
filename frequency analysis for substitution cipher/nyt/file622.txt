Chris Carter is on the telephone to chat up the fifth season of ``The X-Files.'' ``Season 5 had some of the best episodes of the show's entire run,'' Carter says enthusiastically. ``I love `Bad Blood.' `Kill Switch' was great. `Redux' and `Redux Part II' were two of the best mythology episodes we ever did. `Kitsunegari' was a great sequel to `Pusher,' and `The Pine Bluff Variant' was a very interesting idea.'' No, Carter's not stuck in a time warp _ he knows that the show is about to wrap up its ninth and last season. But Fox Home Entertainment will release the fifth-season DVD collection on May 14, and the show's creator/executive producer is doing a bit of tub-thumping on its behalf. The six-disc package will include all 20 episodes, a new 30-minute documentary titled ``The Truth About Season Five,'' deleted scenes, special-effects clips, commentary from Carter about ``The Post-Modern Prometheus'' and a DVD-ROM game entitled ``Earthbound.'' ``Season 5 was also important to the mythology and as a run-up to the `X-Files' movie,'' Carter says from his Los Angeles office on the Fox lot. ``The seven mythology episodes set the stage for the movie and, in a way, for what's going on now.'' What's going on now is the run-up to ``The Truth,'' the two-hour episode that will conclude the show's nine-year stint on Fox. Set to air on May 19, ``The Truth'' heralds the return of David Duchovny as truth-seeking Fox Mulder. Much of the finale unfolds in a courtroom, as Mulder stands trial and looks on as friends and foes alike testify. ``You find out where Mulder has been, what he's been up to,'' Carter says. ``You see a lot of old faces that, if you've been a longtime fan of the show, you haven't seen for a while, and you might wonder how it is that you're seeing them again. And you see a really good story that brings us full circle, back to the pilot. ``We also make some sense of the mythology,'' he promises. ``I'm not suggesting that we can answer everything or answer the unanswerable, but we certainly take a logical, cohesive approach to trying to answer some of the bigger questions. ``Part of the idea is to clear up some of the question marks, so that the next `X-Files' feature can be more of a stand-alone story,'' he adds. ``We want the next film, which you'll probably see in 2004, to be a real Mulder-and-Scully `X-Files' mystery.'' It was Carter himself who decided to pull the plug on `The X-Files' in the face of a steep ratings decline, he says. Legions of fans tuned out after Duchovny's departure and never really gave Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish _ as FBI Special Agents John Doggett and Monica Reyes, respectively _ a chance to win them over. Carter is quick to deny the oft-floated notion that `The X-Files' overstayed its welcome, however, and even quicker to declare that Patrick and Gish are not to blame for the show's demise. ``I thought this was an interesting year to try to take the franchise, which is a good and strong storytelling franchise, and basically repopulate it,'' Carter says. ``The ratings numbers we got this year were representative of a new show, which is what `The X-Files' really was this season. ``It was Fox's decision to bring us back for Season 9,'' he says. ``I'd basically wrapped up everything. They asked me to come back and be a part of it, and I agreed to do that. I think we've done tremendous work. I think Robert and Annabeth did tremendous work. ``The show, while the numbers are down from its Mulder-Scully days, was kind of neck and neck with the ratings of such (freshman) shows as `Alias' and the new `Law and Order' series,'' Carter concludes. ``So I'm very proud of what we've done this year.'' So now it's time for a man who has spent the past nine years fighting the future to sit down and contemplate his own future. It will be a future without cigarette-smoking men, alien hybrids, bees, black oil, lone gunmen and government conspiracies. Or will it? ``First I'm going to take a little break,'' Carter says. ``Once that's done, I owe Fox some more television. I owed them one more year of `The X-Files,' and I also owe them a pilot. So I'll be making good on that, and it'll probably be something close to home. I have a deal at Dimension Films to write a movie with (``X-Files'' co-executive producer) Frank Spotnitz that I will direct. And I have a book that's been lingering around _ I keep pushing the date back further and further, so I've got to get on that. ``And, somewhere in there,'' Carter concludes, ``we'll start work on the next `X-Files' feature.''
