Elvis Costello ``When I Was Cruel'' Island Critic's rating: Three and a half stars of a possible five Elvis Costello evidently misses vinyl records. References to scratches, pops, needles and grooves occur throughout ``When I Was Cruel,'' an album that could benefit from the brevity of records as opposed to CDs. Virtually every song on ``When I Was Cruel'' has something to recommend it, yet the album as a whole doesn't quite gel. The problem is tough to pinpoint. It could be simply that the album could stand to lose a song or two, or at least to have a couple of them shortened. Despite the length, ``When I Was Cruel'' is another sign of artistic revival from a man who once said that he dreaded growing old because he didn't want to be around to witness his artistic decline. In a way, he's already watched it: After releasing a series of good-to-great albums from 1977 to 1982, Costello's ambition and misanthropy grew but his genius became erratic. If you were to divide ``When I Was Cruel'' in half, to give it that two-sided vinyl feel, you'd find that each half starts strong, only to stumble. Several songs ``(45, Tart, Dissolve, Alibi'' and the two-part ``Dust 2 ...'' and ``... dust)'' illustrate Costello's penchant for wordplay, as he wraps whole lyrics around the different meanings of a single word. And he's still best when he rocks out; ``Tear Off Your Own Head'' and ``Daddy Can You Turn This'' could easily have fit his early albums with his longtime back-up trio, the Attractions (two-thirds of whom participate here). But if Dylanesque lyrics, an ABBA quote and a slow samba sample help Costello carry off the seven-minute title cut, the other long songs run out of steam. He spits out ``Episode of Blonde's'' verbose lyrics with impressive vigor (and with great support from Steve Nieve's perky keyboards), but when the song fades in midverse, it's as if even the engineers wished that he would shut up for a second. Nieve, Costello's longtime right-hand man, gives many songs just the embellishment they need; sometimes, the colors come from elsewhere, such as the horns that punctuate ``15 Petals'' or the backing vocals on ``Spooky Girlfriend.'' But the album ends anticlimactically; it has many moments, but too many minutes. (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide Web: www.star-telegram.com) nn
