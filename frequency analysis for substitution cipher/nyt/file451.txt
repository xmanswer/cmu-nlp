As director of the first ``Spider-Man'' movie, Sam Raimi seems to feel it too. Dressed in a plain black suit and tie, Raimi is polite, forthcoming and soft-spoken. But just days before his biggest film opens, he also seems agitated. Does the weight of the world _ and a $100 million budget _ rest on his shoulders? ``I'm just tired,'' Raimi says. ``I was terrified making this film at the beginning, but now it's like a child who's gone off to school. I can't really control it anymore.'' The expected blockbuster, opening Friday, is a huge leap for Raimi. A fan-boy of the fantastic, he grew up loving comics, sci-fi, horror and the Three Stooges. As a filmmaker, he channeled those passions into his daffy, deranged ``Evil Dead'' trilogy and 1990's gothic, comics-inspired ``Darkman.'' In recent years Raimi has gone mainstream, helming the star-studded Western ``The Quick and the Dead,'' Kevin Costner's baseball ode ``For Love of the Game'' and the Billy Bob Thornton drama ``A Simple Plan.'' But unlike ``Spider-Man,'' those weren't big-budget ``franchise'' films expected to make megamillions via theaters, video, merchandising and sequels. More than ever, Raimi is on the spot. Yet he says most of the pressure comes from his own drive to do the tale justice. ``I started reading Spider-Man when I was 7, and I've always loved the character,'' the 42-year-old director says. ``So this film, more than any I've made, is close to my heart.'' Columbia Pictures is convinced: It just signed Raimi to direct ``Spider-Man's'' first sequel. So life is good for the Michigan native, who lives with his wife and three children _ ages 7, 5 and 2 _ in Los Angeles. His kids haven't read Spider-Man comics yet. But Raimi is painfully aware of those who do. Many staunch fans howled at his choice of Tobey Maguire for the title role. Maguire is a subtle actor known for quiet dramas such as ``The Cider House Rules.'' They also complained after learning that the cinematic Spider-Man would shoot organic webs from his wrists, unlike the comics Spidey, who wears mechanical web-shooters. ``I know there are 40 million fans who love Spider-Man,'' Raimi says. ``And I want the fans to be happy. But when making a movie, sometimes you've got to make changes.'' Organic webs stem from an early film treatment written by James Cameron (``Titanic''). Chris Columbus (``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'') also took a shot at directing, as did others. Raimi was far down the line. In short, Spidey may be Marvel's most popular hero, but as a film star he's been spinning his webs in so-called ``development hell'' since the '80s. Warring studios and lawsuits were partly to blame, and so was Marvel. With humanized heroes such as Spider-Man, the Hulk and the Fantastic Four, Marvel supplanted DC _ home of Batman and Superman _ as America's top comics publisher in the 1960s. Yet unlike DC, a sister company of Warner Bros., Marvel stood alone in Hollywood. Its big-screen projects foundered over the years or became wretched TV movies. Things got worse in the '90s, when Marvel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The tide turned when Marvel subsidiary Toy Biz took over, merged the companies and launched Marvel Studios, run by youth-market guru Avi Arad. Under his guidance, Marvel's first ``X-Men'' movie was a smash in 2000; another starts shooting soon. ``Blade'' and its sequel have done well, ``Ghost Rider'' is in development, ``Daredevil'' is filming with Ben Affleck, and ``The Hulk'' starts stomping later this year. But Spider-Man is Marvel's key player on the page and on the screen. ``He is to Marvel what Superman is to DC,'' says Rob Worley of comics2film.com, a Web site that scrutinizes such projects. That's why getting him on film _ and doing it right _ has been a torturous journey. Raimi embarked upon it by digging out his old Spider-Man comics and borrowing others from Marvel. He and screenwriter David Koepp (``The Lost World'') based much of their movie on early yarns written by Stan Lee and drawn by Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr., who also plotted. Faithfully condensing the comics' first decade, the ``Spider-Man'' movie retells their tales of bookish high school student Peter Parker (Maguire), an outcast orphan who lives with his elderly Aunt May and Uncle Ben in a modest New York suburb. Bitten by a genetically altered spider (in the comics it was radioactive), Peter acquires super strength, great agility, a precognitive ``spider sense'' and the ability to climb walls. After a thug he lets go kills Uncle Ben, Peter dons a costume to battle villainy as Spider-Man while living an otherwise normal, if complicated, life. In the comics he dated several girls, including Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy. But the film focuses on one: Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the gal next door with model looks and a feisty personality. In the comics, they eventually wed. Raimi grew up adoring this saga of wild adventures set against teen angst. ``I was as intrigued by Peter Parker as by Spider-Man, because Peter was real _ he was like us,'' Raimi says. ``Superman was an alien pretending to be one of us. But Spider-Man was a human being trying to be a hero.'' Raimi especially related to Peter's rocky love life. ``If I'd had the guts, I'd also have been buying teen-romance comics,'' he says. ``I desperately had to know what would happen in Peter's relationships with girls. For me, getting the girl was always the most important part of the story. That's why I pushed the movie, maybe even more than the comics, into a romance.'' That was fine with Dunst, the spirited young ``Bring It On'' star, who says she ``grew up a girly-girl and wasn't into superheroes. That was a boy thing. But I relate to Spider-Man. He isn't some jock superhero. He's dorky and sweet, and that makes him charming.'' Maguire might argue about the ``dorky'' part, especially after five months of workouts _ up to four hours a day, six days a week. Because Spider-Man often wears a mask, Maguire didn't need to do all the stunts. And professional stuntmen sometimes were replaced by a computer-animated Spider-Man. Led by John Dykstra (``Star Wars''), computer-graphics artists were used to depict Spider-Man swinging through New York's concrete canyons on his webs. Raimi first thought it was a blessing that ``Spider-Man'' wasn't greenlighted until computer-generated effects came along. ``But then I thought, (director) Richard Donner did such a brilliant job with ''Superman`` 25 years ago that I hoped we'd have been smart enough to find a way, too.'' With the comics as a reference, Raimi had what amounted to 40 years' worth of storyboards to study. He put his hero in classic poses, dangling upside down and perched on flagpoles above New York City. Besides hostile newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons), Spidey's chief screen antagonist is the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe plays the role in Jekyll-and-Hyde form, torn between the Goblin's mad violence and the blatant but sane ambitions of his true self, inventor Norman Osborn, who's also the father of Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). Maguire and Dunst have signed to make two more movies. But Raimi is taking things one step at a time. ``I feel a sense of responsibility, and right now I feel I've fulfilled it,'' he says. ``I had this great power, too, to direct `Spider-Man.' But I didn't feel a responsibility to the Internet geeks, if you'll pardon the expression. Instead, I felt a responsibility to the kids who are going to look up to this character in a film whether he's earned it or not, just because he's a hero in a costume. ``For them, I wanted Spider-Man to be a moral person who's worth that admiration. The growth of the human being _ not just beating up bad guys _ is what makes him a true hero.'' XXX END OF STORY
