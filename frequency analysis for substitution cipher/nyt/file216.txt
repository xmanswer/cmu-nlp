Severe thunderstorms erupted on Wednesday across the Ohio and central Mississippi Valleys with many reports of hail and wind damage. On Wednesday, another bout of severe weather is expected in the Middle Atlantic states and Tennessee Valley. A large swath of rain will move into New England ahead of low pressure where onshore breezes keep the coast chilly. High pressure building across the central Plains will promote mostly sunny skies. A few showers will develop in the southern Rockies along a nearly stationary front. Unusually hot weather will continue in South Texas with highs in the 90s and 100s. Much of Florida will have highs in the middle 90s. Low clouds and fog will enshroud much of the Pacific Northwest coast. Coastal Southern California will also be cloudy with brighter skies inland. FOCUS: MAY DAYS A large storm will move across the Northeast on Thursday, but in the month ahead, the weather in most of the nation will change. Since mid-autumn, weather changes have been dominated by storm systems hundreds of miles in diameter. These storms derive their energy from the sharp temperature contrasts in the middle latitudes. Now, as the sun gets higher in the sky, the thermal contrasts that fuel large storms diminish. Instead, strong solar heating creates small hot spots that produce rising columns of air, which lead to thundershowers of only a few miles wide.
