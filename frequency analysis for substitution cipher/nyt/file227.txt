TRANSMITTED MAY 1, 2002: PARASITIC FLATWORM CAUSES LIMB DEFORMITIES IN FROGS NATGEO-TODAY-DEFORMED-FROGS-MAY01 _ Why frogs suddenly have started sprouting legs out of their mouths or growing extra limbs has confounded scientists for over a decade, but now a researcher only a few years out of college believes he has pinpointed the culprit _ a parasitic flatworm no bigger than a period. ``Our study supports the hypothesis that trematode infection is a major cause of limb malformations in natural amphibian populations,'' Pieter Johnson, 25, writes in the latest issue of Ecological Monographs, ``Simply stated, the greater the amphibian population's infection, the higher the frequency and severity of limb malformations.'' A report. By Bijal P. Trivedi. 800 words.
