The Board of Education's study assessing the psychological impact of the Sept. 11 terror attack on public-school children is based on questionnaires filled out in February and March by 8,266 students in 4th through 12th grades. About 900 students from each grade participated, at a total of 94 schools throughout the city. Students attending schools near ground zero or in other neighborhoods of the city disproportionately affected by the attack and the November plane crash made up two-thirds of the sample. But they, along with the remainder of the sample, were randomly selected from their region. The probability of a school's being selected for the study was weighted in proportion to its size. The results were weighted to take account of the oversampling in ground zero and other neighborhoods disproportionately affected by the events, so as to be representative of the city's entire public school population. The researchers did not calculate a margin of sampling error for the overall results, but said that because the sample size was so large, the margin of sampling error was certain to be small.
