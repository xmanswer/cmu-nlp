Many residents of Georgia's Gordon County are trying to pick up the pieces after a tornado sent 100 mph winds through their neighborhood causing millions of dollars of property damage. No lives were lost and no injuries were reported in the battering storm, but about 25,000 people were left without electricity, said state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine. Of the 5,000 Georgia Power customers affected, fewer than 400 were still without power by late afternoon, spokesman John Sell said. Oxendine estimated the damage at $3 million to $5 million. The National Weather Service concluded that a weak tornado was imbedded in the storm as it moved through the county. In Gordon on Wednesday morning, the only casualties were buildings. Many businesses were damaged, and the walls of the gymnasium at Calhoun Elementary School collapsed. The mess was widespread. Old, towering trees were blown over or snapped in two, blocking dozens of streets and all but hiding some houses. Business was good for people who earn a living wielding a chain saw. Business was terrible for almost everyone. With no electricity, most shops couldn't open. Gas stations had no way to pump gasoline from underground tanks and restaurants couldn't even heat coffee. No traffic lights were working, and Calhoun police and Gordon County sheriff's deputies struggled to direct carloads of curious storm gazers away from the worst-hit areas so that cleanup crews could do their work.
