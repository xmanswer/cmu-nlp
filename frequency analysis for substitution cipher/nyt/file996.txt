Forgive Cee-Lo Green for being worried. His solo CD, ``Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections'' was released a week ago and at the moment he's wondering if fans will snap it up. It doesn't matter that he's released three gold records as a member of the politically correct rap quartet Goodie MOb. Those attention-grabbing guest vocals on Santana's comeback CD, ``Supernatural,'' and ``Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik'' by OutKast? Please. Green knows that the people who buy rap are fickle creatures. ``I don't think that my album is a hip-hop album, and I'm not sure if the hip-hop audience will truly embrace it,'' says Green, a tad pensively, in the leisurely drawl of his native Atlanta. ``From my background, they may think it's a regression rather than a progression.'' They would be wrong. Green's introspective debut barrels forward, offering an aural revelation on par with the debuts of Alicia Keys and D'Angelo. It's a 21-song, genre-defying collection about redemption, individuality, and spirituality that dabbles in jazz, rock, and soul. Occasionally rapping, Green more often molds the songs with a weary, blues-infused wail honed in the churches of his hometown. A true child of MTV, he casually samples Primus and the Mary Jane Girls in one song. Green stalks the path laid by his eccentric OutKast cohorts Dre and Big Boi, flying the freak flag fashioned by Parliament and Sly &AMP; the Family Stone. No wonder Rolling Stone has profiled him, Vibe magazine is calling him ``Southern soul personified,'' and ``Late Show With David Letterman'' has aired his band's horn-blaring, soul revuelike live performance. He and Philly crooner Musiq kick off their 22-city club tour at Avalon on Saturday. So don't hate Green for succumbing to the rap tradition of boasting by boldly calling his CD ``a courageous act of individualism.'' After all, R&AMP;B and hip-hop seem to be stuck in a lyrical rut of Courvoisier and Cadillacs. ``I think it should be quite evident that it's time for a change, time for something fresh, exciting, fun, you know what I'm saying,'' says Green, who speaks in sentences that bob and weave, intertwining street slang with the diction of a well-read man. ``I think I was able to do that with this album. Of course, it's against the grain, but haven't I always been?'' Green laid down his musical challenge a few months ago with the funk fest, ``Closet Freak.'' The video for the single was so striking that whenever it played on BET you felt compelled to watch it. There was Green with his bald chocolate dome and Vandyke beard looking like a new-millennium Isaac Hayes with extra layers of body fat. In one shot, he's creeping across the screen in platform boots and a sunburst yellow dashiki. Sure, three female backup singers shake their groove thang in the video, but they are not accessories. In fact, the woman with the long golden braids whispering the ``la la la'' chorus into Green's ear? That's his wife. ``I don't need naked women to sell my product, you know what I mean,'' says Green. ``The women-and-cars type of imagery is synonymous with what hip-hop is. You see Moby and people making a mockery of it because it has become that monotonous and that repetitive.'' It's hard to believe that when the Goodie MOb released its critically lauded debut, ``Soul Food,'' Green was garbed in a track suit or a baggy T. Now Green loudly voices his disappointment about the commercial nature of the Goodie MOb's 1999 outing, ``World Party.'' ``When you're in a group situation, you have to confine yourself to (writing) a verse, and all of the opinions and stances aren't the same,'' says Green. ``I just needed a separate medium to express a complete thought of how I feel and the direction I want my music to go.'' The son of a Baptist minister who died when Green was 2, Green (christened Thomas Callaway) grew up in the church. By his teenage years, he had officially become the black sheep of the family, dropping out of school in the ninth grade and running the Atlanta streets. He's doesn't detail what he was doing there, but he talks about his move away from the dark side and his spiritual rehabilitation with all the intensity a 26-year-old can muster. ``I speak with the eloquence of a Harvard graduate,'' he says. ``I defied the odds against me.'' He also says: ``I believe that my life was spared. My music is to praise God for saving my life and allowing me to behold that in a vision of beauty and sight and sound and options and choice.'' The music he makes is also a spiritual offering to his mother, who died in 1995 _ just before ``Soul Food'' was released _ from injuries sustained in a car accident that paralyzed her from the neck down. ``Any grain of worry that I caused my mother, worry about if I'm dead _ '' Green begins _ ``my music is to redeem all of that because I believe she's listening.'' The theme bleeds into many songs here. On ``Big Ole Words (damn)'' he sings, ``I remember when my development was arrested / I was doing time in my mind misguided and misdirected / I was sick, so sick that if I spoke you'd be infected / Then my consciousness was cleared of all charges and I came out corrected.'' Green also uses the CD to give praise to the church of individuality. He derides society as a haven that encourages people to go with the status quo. With ``Closet Freak,'' he tells people to march to the beat of their own funky drummer. ``People think it's sexual,'' he says of the song. No doubt they reach that conclusion because of lyrics that have the singer testifying ``sometimes I like freaking in the morning, sometimes I like freaking at night.'' But let Green explain: ``It's actually about embracing that oddness about oneself and standing up and being counted.'' On ``One for the Road,'' he lays out his goals and derides some of his peers. In this tongue twister, he raps, ``I'd forgive those who rhyme / To kill the time, while mine cultivates the consciousness / and chill the spine.'' In Green's mind, hip-hop offers too much Nelly and not enough Public Enemy, although he doesn't criticize specific artists. No, he simply states, ``Hip-hop has become heartless, literally. It's almost robotic, no conscience. (That's) amusing and entertaining to begin with, but detrimental in the long run.'' So call ``Perfect Imperfections'' counterprogramming from a man who aspires to the artistic heights of Ralph Lauren rather than the mainstream lows of Cross Colors. Or as Cee-Lo Green puts it in his perfectly imperfect words: ``I don't wish to waste time and opportunity with the platform that I've been privileged to have. I would much rather be remembered for something positive and constructive and with substance and meaning.'' Vanessa Jones can be reached at v(underscore)jones(at)globe.com.
