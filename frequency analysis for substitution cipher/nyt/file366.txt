Federal authorities have concluded that there is no evidence that Mohamed Atta, the suspected ringleader of the Sept. 11 attacks, met with an Iraqi intelligence officer before the hijackings. Reports that Atta had met with an Iraqi agent in Prague in early 2001 circulated widely after the attacks, suggesting a possible connection with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Reports of the meeting have persisted, based primarily on accounts of Czech officials like Prime Minister Milos Zeman, who discussed it with officials in Washington in November. Federal law-enforcement officials have said for months that their investigation, including a search of immigration records in the Czech Republic and the United States, had found no evidence. This week a senior Bush administration official appeared to close the matter, saying FBI and CIA analysts had firmly concluded that no meeting had occurred, a conclusion first reported by Newsweek magazine.
