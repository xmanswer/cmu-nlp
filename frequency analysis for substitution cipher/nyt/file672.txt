Brisk breezes from the Northwest will direct much cooler air into the Middle Atlantic States in the wake of a front pushing off the coast. Winds will also be quite strong in New England where gusts could exceed 50 mph. The Northeast will be dry with ample sun near the coast and patchy clouds in the interior. Scattered thunderstorms will surround a cold front draped from Texas to the Carolinas. Some storms will be severe, with damaging winds and hail. Flooding is also expected, especially in places that have repetitive storms. The Gulf Coast and Florida will remain hot. Isolated afternoon thunderstorms will erupt in the western Plains as a cold front lifts a surge of warmer air arriving from the south. Most of the West will be dry and sunny, though patchy clouds will cover the coast. FOCUS: A STRANGE MONTH Last month tied for the third-warmest April in New York City with an average temperature of 56.1 degrees. Yet below-average temperatures were recorded on more than half of the days in New York. It is very rare for a month to be one of the warmest of record, yet have so many days that were cool. In New York, April began and ended chilly. A brief, intense warm spell during the middle of the month caused the city to have one of its warmest Aprils. For only the second April since records have been kept, the temperature in New York exceeded 90 degrees on three consecutive days.
