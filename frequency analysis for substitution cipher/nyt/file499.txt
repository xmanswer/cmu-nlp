In ``Spider-Man,'' the title hero (Tobey Maguire) rescues Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). As he hangs upside down, she peels his mask from his lips, and they share a rain-drenched, nose-to-chin smooch. The actors performed this perilous pucker at the end of nightlong shoot. In take after take they locked lips, trying to look amorous while getting soaked. ``It was really uncomfortable,'' says Dunst, who turns 20 Tuesday. ``It was 5 a.m., wet and cold, and Tobey couldn't breathe, so it was like, `kiss kiss kiss,' then `wheeze.''' Maguire, 26, says he ``still managed to derive some pleasure out of the scene. But it was challenging.'' When Dunst raised his mask, ``it was on my nose, and then she was kissing my mouth, so I had to try to suck air out of the corners of our mouths.'' Besides that, water ran up Maguire's nose _ ``or, I should say, down my nose.'' Though the stars were rumored to be intimate off the set, both deny it. Yet Dunst adored their on-screen romance, which she calls the film's ``emotional drive.'' XXX END OF STORY
