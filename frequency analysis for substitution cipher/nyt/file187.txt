An elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease was apparently unaware that her husband had died when a sheriff's deputy found her alone and malnourished. A deputy found the decomposed body of Bill Cornelius, 83, late Monday behind the couple's home. Doris Cornelius, 74, was inside and appeared to have eaten little since her husband died several days earlier. Bill Cornelius was last seen alive two weeks ago, Bandera County Chief Deputy Matt King said Tuesday. The elderly woman was treated at a hospital in Kerrville. Doris Cornelius is severely affected by Alzheimer's disease, according to a woman who occasionally helped the couple. ``Around evening her medicine would start wearing off and she would want to go visit relatives, but they don't have any relatives around here,'' said Acenith Cherry. ``I don't think Doris really comprehended that Bill was dead.'' Such mental lapses are not unusual in those with severe dementia, according to a physician who said that the case underscores the need for regular supervision and a structured environment for such patients. ``Someone with advanced Alzheimer's might not recognize family members, their own home, or even know who they are,'' said Gary Gronseth, chairman of the neurology department at Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio. A deputy checking on the Corneliuses on Monday night at the request of their son, who lives out of state, said Doris Cornelius told him that her husband was asleep. A strong odor led the deputy to suspect otherwise. ``Upon looking into the bedroom, it was obvious that a body had decomposed there, but the body was not in the bedroom,'' said King. The corpse was found in the back yard, King said. Officers suspect that Doris Cornelius dragged the body there, King said, but she had no recollection of doing so. Utopia is about 40 miles west of San Antonio.
