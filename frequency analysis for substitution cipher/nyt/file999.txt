Too young for the Spandex and nose candy of the disco era, and too sheltered for the decadent days of glam rock, Tjinder Singh might seem an unlikely savior of both sounds. But this former child chess champion from the gritty industrial city of Wolverhampton, England, grew up listening to Bollywood film scores and Steppenwolf in a soundscape thriving with sitars and guitars. Singh, 34, is a product of cultural duality, a specimen of artistic hybrid vigor who has a knack for wooing listeners with songs about things they know nothing about. His 1997 gem ``Brimful of Asha'' and its achingly sweet hook _ ``Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow, mine's on the 45'' _ was an earnest tribute to a Bollywood star, Asha Bhosle, who has recorded more than 12,000 songs for Indian films. Perhaps this unlikely savior is the best person for the job. Singh's band, Cornershop, performs at the Paradise Rock Club on Wednesday. He's riding the crest of a new disc and a newfound appreciation. ``Handcream for a Generation'' bounces across a spectrum; classic disco nuzzles against Punjabi folk; wry political lyrics float on wheezing organ fills. Nearly everything on the disc is infused with bass beats that demand attention. ``It's been very positive, really,'' Singh said in a telephone interview. ``The critics liked it. It was all pretty much hands in the air. And the word of mouth is pretty big on it as well.'' He's happiest about that last bit, that without much airplay in the United States, the band has started fans talking again. ``It's the most effective marketing. It's the old-school one,'' Singh said. Cornershop is back, after four years away from the road and the hassles associated with keeping a music career from slipping into the margins. Singh recorded a side project as Clinton, but Cornershop is his rock, his anchor. It makes perfect sense that ``Handcream for a Generation'' should contain moments of funk bliss that seem to summon the soul of Sly &AMP; the Family Stone, or Booker T. &AMP; the MG's. There's hope and joy and pride and dreams, to paraphrase the Rolling Stones, but Singh is amazed that any of those feelings might have emerged from the disc. ``It's not really a reflection of what was going on in my head. The logistics of recording it were pretty terrible. My dad died, my son was born. I was going through a lot at the time,'' Singh said. ``When people say that it's a party album, I find that quite amazing.'' Cornershop has always had a sharp edge just under the glib pop hooks. When ``Brimful of Asha'' hit US shores, few Americans understood that Cornershop took its name from a stereotype _ every Asian in England worked behind the counter of a convenience store. On ``Handcream,'' the song ``Wogs Will Walk'' twists an ethnic slur into an affirmation of dignity. Here and throughout the disc, Singh and his longtime bandmate, Ben Ayres, produce songs that never dive into moody angst-pop. ``I wasn't feeling that funky when I was doing this album, because there was lot of bad stuff going on,'' Singh said, alluding to family stress as well as muddy dealings with Warner Bros. and Virgin Records. ``I wanted that if this was going to be our last album, that it be a strong one to go out on.'' On several songs, the repeated line ``I understand guns in the A&AMP;R office'' punctuates his lingering mistrust of major labels. The phrase refers to tales of early hip-hop performers who casually toyed with pistols in contract negotiations, to reverse the intimidation posed by a big office and nimble record-company lawyers. Despite this, it's difficult to find any traces of Singh's fatalism on ``Handcream for a Generation.'' From the horns leaping into the first four bars of ``Heavy Soup,'' the disc resurrects innumerable musical influences and at least one overlooked icon: the American soul singer Otis Clay. Political, but not preachy or pretentious, Cornershop delivers social messages coated in Stax-influenced horn riffs and a meringue of layered guitars. The Oasis guitarist, Noel Gallagher, elevates the 14-minute track ``Spectral Mornings'' into a space-rock opus. ``Lessons Learned from Rocky I to Rocky III'' is one of the standout tracks, a sharp stick in the eye of corporate-rock revivalists. The song takes its cues from the Stones and the Stooges; it mixes in some T. Rex and the Faces for good measure, but it never sounds dated or forced. It's an effective parody by example. ``I wouldn't want people to feel forced to think, but I want them to understand some parts of it,'' Singh said. ``Whether they like it for the lyrics, or whether they like it for the politics, I just want it to get to them.''
